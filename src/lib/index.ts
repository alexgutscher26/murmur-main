/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: lib-barrel, cn, springFor, transitionFor, useCommand,
 *   useTauriEvent, formatClock, formatRelativeTime, bindingFromCapture, iconFor
 * WHAT:  Barrel for src/lib — the frontend's non-visual helpers.
 * WHY:   One import path per folder boundary (CLAUDE.md §8), so a consumer
 *        never has to know which file inside lib/ owns a helper. bindings.ts is
 *        deliberately NOT re-exported: it is generated, and importing it by its
 *        real path keeps it obvious in every file which types came from Rust.
 * WHERE: Imported by every entry, view and global component.
