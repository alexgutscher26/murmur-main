/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: iconFor, ICONS, LucideIcon, normaliseIconName, FALLBACK_ICON
 * WHAT:  Resolves the registry's `nav.icon` string to a Lucide component.
 * WHY:   The registry names an icon and the frontend resolves it (NavDef), so
 *        the nav is never hardcoded. Resolution is a named-import map rather
 *        than `import * as icons`: the star import defeats tree-shaking and
 *        drags all 1,500 icons into the bundle for the sake of the six the app
 *        uses. An unknown name degrades to an obviously-wrong glyph instead of
 *        throwing — a nav item with the wrong icon is a blemish, a nav that
 *        crashes is an unusable window. Every name the registry actually
 *        declares is asserted to resolve by a test, so the fallback is a safety
 *        net rather than something a real build is ever allowed to reach.
 * WHERE: The dashboard sidebar. Names are matched case- and separator-insensitively,
 *        so "bar-chart", "BarChart" and "bar_chart" all resolve.

/**
 * WHAT:  What an unresolvable icon name renders as.
 * WHY:   It used to be CircleDot, and that is precisely why two wrong icons
 *        shipped: a neat circle with a dot in it looks like a DESIGNED icon, so
 *        Billing and Stats sat in the sidebar wearing a plausible glyph until
 *        the operator noticed. A fallback's job here is not to look acceptable,
 *        it is to look WRONG — a question mark is read as "this is missing" in
 *        about a second, by anyone, without checking anything.
 *
 *        It still falls back rather than throwing: a nav item with the wrong
 *        icon is a blemish, a nav that crashes is an unusable window. The
 *        guarantee that it never renders at all is a test, not a throw — see
 *        src-tauri/src/registry/icons.rs.
