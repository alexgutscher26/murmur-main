/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: bindingFromCapture, glyphsForBinding, displayForBinding,
 *   MODIFIER_GLYPH, CODE_GLYPH, HotkeyBinding, KeyModifier
 * WHAT:  Converts between a captured keystroke, the registry's HotkeyBinding,
 *        and the glyphs a Keycap renders.
 * WHY:   HotkeyBinding.key is KeyboardEvent.code — the PHYSICAL key — while the
 *        glyph a user reads comes from the layout. Those are different things
 *        and conflating them is how a rebind works on a US keyboard and binds
 *        the wrong key on an AZERTY one. So the binding stores `code` and only
 *        this file turns it into something readable; nothing else formats a
 *        hotkey.
 * WHERE: Fed by the setting-control hotkey capture, consumed by Settings, the
 *        onboarding hotkey step and any empty state showing the shortcut.

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: MODIFIER_CODES, isModifierCode
 * WHAT:  The `KeyboardEvent.code` values for the modifier keys themselves.
 * WHY:   Matched on CODE, not on `event.key`. When Option is held, macOS
 *        rewrites `event.key` into the character the chord produces — ⌥S
 *        arrives as "ß" — so any rule written against `key` behaves differently
 *        depending on which modifiers are down. `code` is the physical key and
 *        never moves, which is also why HotkeyBinding stores it.
 *
 *        Lives here rather than in the capture control because two things need
 *        the same answer now: the control, deciding whether a press is a whole
 *        binding, and glyphsForBinding, deciding whether a binding has a key
 *        cap to draw at all.
