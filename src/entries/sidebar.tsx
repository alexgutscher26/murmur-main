/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: sidebar-entry, SidebarWindow, nav-selected,
 *   sidebar.html, detached-rail
 * WHAT:  The detached navigation rail's entry point — the floating window that
 *        sits to the left of the dashboard.
 * WHY:   Its own window, and therefore its own Vite entry, because the GAP
 *        between the rail and the main panel has to be genuinely transparent to
 *        show the desktop through it. A single window cannot do that: its
 *        vibrancy is one rectangle covering the whole frame, so the gap would
 *        render as glass rather than as a hole.
 *
 *        The window is a CHILD of the dashboard (NSWindow addChildWindow), so
 *        macOS moves, orders, minimises and hides it with its parent. Nothing
 *        here tracks the parent's position; anything we wrote ourselves would
 *        drift on move and flicker on resize.
 *
 *        Navigation travels one way, rail to dashboard, over `nav-selected`.
 *        The rail keeps its own highlight optimistically rather than waiting
 *        for an echo, because it is the only thing in the app that changes the
 *        route — so the two cannot disagree in normal use.
 * WHERE: Loaded by sidebar.html, which bootstrap opens and attaches.
