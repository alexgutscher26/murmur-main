/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: Pill, PillBody, SessionState, sessionStateChanged,
 *   VisibleState, PillTone, pill-width, pill-width-failed, window-is-the-pill
 * WHAT:  The overlay. Renders the current SessionState and nothing else — dot,
 *        waveform or countdown ring, the elapsed timer, or a failure sentence.
 * WHY:   THE WINDOW IS THE PILL. The NSPanel is sized to the pill's tokens and
 *        its vibrancy carries --radius-pill, so every pixel of the window is
 *        painted glass in the pill's shape and there is no slack to hide a
 *        mistake in. Three rules follow, and breaking any one of them puts the
 *        grey rectangle back on screen:
 *
 *        1. THE PILL FILLS THE WINDOW. It never animates its own width and
 *           never transforms itself. A CSS morph would race a native window
 *           resize that is not frame-locked to it, and every frame where the
 *           two disagree is bare glass beside the pill. Motion that moves the
 *           pill AS AN OBJECT — arriving, resizing, leaving — belongs to the
 *           window, in Rust. Motion INSIDE the pill belongs here.
 *        2. IDLE NEVER BLANKS THE VIEW. Rust hides the window on IDLE, and the
 *           same transition also reaches this webview over IPC. Those two do
 *           not land on the same frame, so a view that cleared on IDLE would
 *           leave an empty glass capsule on screen until the native hide caught
 *           up — a grey blob flashing at the end of every single dictation.
 *           The view therefore renders the last state that had something to say
 *           and lets the window take it away. `live` is tracked separately so
 *           the elapsed timer still STOPS on IDLE; only the pixels persist.
 *        3. THE SWITCH IS EXHAUSTIVE, with a `never` assertion rather than a
 *           default. A new variant in the Rust enum has to become a compile
 *           error here, not a silently blank pill.
 *
 *        It holds no domain state: get_session_state is called ONCE for first
 *        paint and every frame after that comes from session-state-changed, so
 *        there is no second copy of the truth and nothing to poll (CLAUDE.md §7).
 * WHERE: Mounted by src/entries/pill.tsx into the NSPanel window. Sizes come
 *        from tokens.css, which src-tauri/src/tray.rs reads and asserts against
 *        its own constants. Draws with the global Waveform and CountdownRing.

/**
 * WHAT:  The surface tint per state.
 * WHY:   Only failure tints now. docs/04 §7 used to say the pill TURNS its
 *        state colour, and with an ember accent that meant a wash for cancel
 *        and for delivery too. There is no accent hue any more, so a neutral
 *        "tint" would be a wash the same colour as the pill — a layer that
 *        costs a paint and communicates nothing. What separates the states is
 *        FORM: a moving waveform, a draining line, a sentence. Hue was
 *        decorating a distinction that form had already made, which is exactly
 *        why removing it costs nothing.
 *
 *        Failure keeps its wash because that is the one state where losing the
 *        distinction is a safety problem rather than a style one. Still the
 *        soft variant: at full strength over vibrancy this is a red box, and
 *        the pill is an indicator, not an alert. Always rendered and
 *        transparent at rest, so the colour morphs on a state change instead
 *        of a tinted layer popping into existence (docs/04 §6).

 *        is not information, it is a flicker — the pill would appear, flash a

 *        the recording layout with a resting waveform and an unpulsed dot means
 *        the pill arrives already in its working shape and simply comes alive
 *        as sound reaches it, which is the whole feel the app is after. If
 *        arming genuinely stalls, the device error surfaces as FAILED.
