/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: toControlSetting, DynamicOptions, SettingValueOf,
 *   valueFromControl, RegistrySettingDef, SettingKind, SettingValue
 * WHAT:  Adapts one registry SettingDef plus its stored SettingValue into the
 *        declarative shape SettingControl renders, and back again on change.
 * WHY:   The two shapes are deliberately different. The registry describes what
 *        a setting IS — kind, bounds, options, defaults — and knows nothing
 *        about React; the control describes what to RENDER and needs a value and
 *        an onChange bound to it. This file is the only place those meet, so
 *        neither side has to know about the other, and adding a SettingKind in
 *        Rust surfaces here as a non-exhaustive switch rather than as a control
 *        that silently renders nothing. DYNAMIC_CHOICE options are resolved by
 *        the caller and passed in, because they come from other commands.
 *        `requires_engine` and `requires_permission` are both enforced here: a
 *        setting the engine cannot honour, or whose OS grant is missing, is
 *        disabled and SAYS what is missing rather than being offered and doing
 *        nothing. "Paste automatically: ON" while Accessibility is denied is a
 *        control that lies — the user said yes, the app agreed, and every
 *        session still delivered clipboard-only.
 *
 *        A blocked control keeps its STORED VALUE rather than reading as off.
 *        The preference is real; it simply cannot take effect yet, and the
 *        disabled state plus the reason already carry that. Showing it as off
 *        would destroy the user's actual setting to say something the reason
 *        line says better — and it would appear to flip itself on the moment
 *        the grant arrived, which looks like the app editing their choices.
 * WHERE: Used by SettingsView.tsx. Bridges lib/bindings.ts to
 *        components/global/setting-control.
