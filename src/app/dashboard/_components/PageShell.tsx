/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: PageShell, PageHeader, page-header-height,
 *   data-tauri-drag-region, data-scroll-area, traffic-lights
 * WHAT:  The frame every dashboard page is rendered into: a sticky page header
 *        overlaying a scrolling body.
 * WHY:   THE HEADER IS WHY THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS LOOKED WRONG. macOS draws them
 *        over the content at a fixed offset, and they span to roughly 66px —
 *        wider than the 56px sidebar rail — so they spilled out of the rail and
 *        floated over the page with nothing to belong to. The fix is not to
 *        move the lights, it is to give them a band that continues across the
 *        content pane: this header's first row is exactly --page-header-height,
 *        the same height the sidebar reserves at its top, so the page title and
 *        the three lights sit on one centre line.
 *
 *        IT OVERLAYS THE BODY RATHER THAN SITTING ABOVE IT, because the ask was
 *        that content tuck under the header and fade out. That only works if
 *        they occupy the same space. The consequence is handled in exactly one
 *        place — ScrollArea's headerInset pads the content down past this bar —
 *        so no page has to remember not to hide its first line.
 *
 *        THE WHOLE BAR IS THE DRAG REGION and it is deliberately taller than
 *        the title needs, because the previous one was reported as hard to
 *        grab: it lived INSIDE each page's scroller, so it slid away the moment
 *        anyone scrolled and the draggable surface went with it. Out here it
 *        never moves. Interactive children opt out with data-tauri-drag-region
 *        ={false}; without that a button inside the bar drags the window
 *        instead of firing.
 *
 *        The wheel forwarding is not a flourish. The header overlays the
 *        scroller but is not inside it, so a wheel event over the bar has no
 *        scrollable ancestor to bubble to and the page would simply refuse to
 *        scroll under the cursor. Forwarding it to the sibling marked
 *        data-scroll-area restores what the user expects without putting the
 *        header inside the scroller — where the fade mask, which paints on the
 *        scroll container's own box, would erase the title along with the
 *        content.
 * WHERE: Wrapped around every routed view by Dashboard. The title comes from
 *        the capability registry's NavDef.label, so a new page added to the
 *        registry is titled without touching this file.

        {/* THE LEFT PADDING IS --titlebar-safe-inset, NOT the page padding, and
            it became necessary the moment the rail moved into its own window.
            macOS draws the three buttons from the window's top-left out to
            roughly 72px. The 56px rail used to absorb them, which is the only
            reason the title has ever looked right; with the rail gone the title
            would start at 32px, directly underneath them.

            It does leave the title indented further than the content below it.
            That is the standard macOS arrangement — toolbar items begin after
            the lights, body content sits on its own grid — and it is the price
            of the operator's explicit ask that the title line up with the three
            controls. The alternative, dropping the title to its own row below
            the buttons, aligns with the content but stops honouring that.

            The title sits in the TRAFFIC-LIGHT BAND, not in the middle of the
            header. macOS puts the three buttons at a fixed inset from the
            window's top-left and centres them in a standard 28pt title bar;
            centring the title in the taller header instead dropped it a few
            pixels below them, which is exactly the "not in line" that got
            reported. The header stays taller because the drag target and the
            content inset both want the room — only the alignment uses the
            band. */}
