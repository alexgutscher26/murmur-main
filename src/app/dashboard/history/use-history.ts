/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: useHistory, HistoryFeed, listHistory, searchHistory,
 *   PAGE_SIZE, loadMore, exhausted
 * WHAT:  The history feed: a paginated list_history, swapped for search_history
 *        while a query is present, with loadMore/refresh and the rows it has so
 *        far.
 * WHY:   History reaches tens of thousands of rows, so it is never fetched
 *        whole — pages accumulate as the virtualized list reaches its end.
 *        Search is a different command rather than a filter over the loaded
 *        pages, because filtering client-side would only ever search the
 *        handful of pages that happen to be in memory and would quietly report
 *        "no results" for a session that exists. A generation counter guards
 *        the swap: a page requested before the query changed must not be
 *        appended after it.
 * WHERE: Owned by HistoryView.tsx. Wraps list_history / search_history.
