/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: HistoryRow, SessionSummary, OutcomeBadge,
 *   firstLine, DeliveryKind, SessionOutcome
 * WHAT:  One history row: the first line of the transcript, then duration ·
 *        language · word count · relative time, with a badge when the session
 *        did not deliver cleanly.
 * WHY:   Failed and orphaned sessions are shown, not hidden — recovering the
 *        one that went wrong is the entire reason history exists (docs/01 §7).
 *        Cancelled sessions cannot appear because the backend destroys them, so
 *        there is no filter for them here. The row falls back to `raw_text` when
 *        `final_text` is absent: a failed session still has words worth reading,
 *        and showing nothing would imply the audio was lost. A failed row leads
 *        its metadata with the REASON and still carries the duration, so the
 *        user learns both what went wrong and how much audio it happened to —
 *        docs/04 §9. The reason goes on the metadata line rather than a third
 *        line because the row height is fixed by the virtualized list, and a
 *        third line would overflow it. The reason is `error_message`, rendered
 *        VERBATIM — it is written once where the failure happened, which knows
 *        more about itself than any later reader does. This file deliberately
 *        holds no code-to-sentence map: that would be a second set of wording
 *        for failures the app already has words for, and it would drift.
 * WHERE: The renderRow slot of the history DataList.
