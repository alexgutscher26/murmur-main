/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: TourStep, TourSlide, TOUR_SLIDES, onboarding-tour,
 *   tour-media, onboarding-gif
 * WHAT:  The three-slide tour that opens onboarding: what the app does, in the
 *        order a new user needs it. Logo, a media slot, one line of copy, dots.
 * WHY:   THIS TEACHES, IT DOES NOT SET UP. The setup steps that follow are
 *        derived from backend state — permission granted, model ready — and
 *        that is right for them, because a returning user must not repeat work
 *        they already did. A tour has no backend state to derive from: it is
 *        three pages of reading, so it is the one part of this flow that is
 *        honestly a counter, and pretending otherwise would be architecture for
 *        its own sake.
 *
 *        THE THIRD SLIDE IS THE PRODUCT. Murmur transcribes on the user's own
 *        machine, and nothing in the app said so anywhere — a person could use
 *        it for a week believing their voice was being uploaded. That is the
 *        single most valuable sentence here and it gets its own slide rather
 *        than a clause at the end of another one.
 *
 *        THE MEDIA SLOT IS RESERVED BUT NOT REQUIRED. The operator is supplying
 *        GIFs later, so the box is sized and positioned now and the file is the
 *        only thing missing: drop `step-1.gif`, `step-2.gif`, `step-3.gif` into
 *        `public/onboarding/` and they appear, no code change. Until then the
 *        slot renders nothing at all until a file is there — an empty bordered
 *        rectangle on the first screen anyone ever sees reads as broken, not as
 *        pending, and this flow ships before the media does. Logo, heading and
 *        one line is a finished minimal screen without it.
 * WHERE: Rendered by Onboarding before the permission/model/hotkey steps.
