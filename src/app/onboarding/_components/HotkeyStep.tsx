/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: HotkeyStep, transcriptDelivered, sessionStateChanged,
 *   hotkey-test, Keycap
 * WHAT:  The hotkey test: shows the shortcut as keys and waits for a real
 *        session to complete.
 * WHY:   The step is not finished by a button that says "I tried it" — it is
 *        finished by the app actually observing a delivery. That is the only
 *        evidence that the hotkey registered, the microphone opened, the model
 *        ran and delivery worked, which is the whole point of testing rather
 *        than asserting.
 *
 *        It listens on transcriptDelivered rather than on the session state,
 *        and the difference is not cosmetic. Delivery moved off the session
 *        state machine so that releasing the hotkey frees the app immediately,
 *        which means the state stream now ends at "the recording stopped" and
 *        can no longer testify that any words arrived. Completing this step on
 *        a stopped recording — or on a timer — would pass while nothing was
 *        delivered, in the one screen whose entire job is proving that
 *        dictation works.
 *        A transient failure is not drawn in red here for the same reason it is
 *        not in the pill, and it matters more here: this step IS a first launch,
 *        so the engine is at its least warm exactly when the user is told to
 *        press the key. "Still starting up" in red would be the first thing they
 *        ever see the app say.
 * WHERE: Step three of onboarding.
