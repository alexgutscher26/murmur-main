/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: ErrorSurface, ErrorSurfaceProps, ACTION_LABEL,
 *   ErrorAction, AppError, runErrorAction
 * WHAT:  Renders an AppError as something a user can act on: the plain-language
 *        message, and the one button its ErrorAction says would fix it.
 * WHY:   AppError is the only error crossing IPC precisely so the UI has one
 *        error surface rather than forty (CLAUDE.md §4) — this is that surface.
 *        The two recoveries that are pure IPC, opening a privacy pane and
 *        re-downloading a model, are performed here rather than re-implemented
 *        by each caller; retry and navigation are callbacks, because only the
 *        host knows what to re-run or where to go. Action wording lives in one
 *        map so the same remedy never reads two ways in two views. `detail` is
 *        never rendered: it is a sqlite or CoreAudio string, which is noise to
 *        the user and a support burden to us.
 * WHERE: Every dashboard view, the model manager and onboarding. Built on
 *        EmptyState so a failure and an absence share one visual language.
