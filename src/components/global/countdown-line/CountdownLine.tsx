/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: CountdownLine, CountdownLineProps, CountdownLineState,
 *   remainingMs, DRIFT_MS, scaleX, WebAnimations, countdown-line-height
 * WHAT:  A horizontal line that starts full and drains to empty over the time
 *        the backend says is left. Can be handed back (refilled) mid-drain.
 * WHY:   REPLACES THE COUNTDOWN RING, WHICH WAS BROKEN, AND THE BUG IS WORTH
 *        KNOWING BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO REINTRODUCE. The ring re-ran its effect
 *        on [state, durationMs], and durationMs WAS the state's remaining_ms —
 *        a value Rust re-emits several times a second. So every tick cancelled
 *        the running animation and started a fresh full-to-empty drain over the
 *        new remainder. It never progressed and it flickered, because it was
 *        being restarted five times a second. Two clocks disagreeing, exactly.
 *
 *        The fix is that the animation is created ONCE, when the drain begins,
 *        and later ticks may only SEEK it — never restart it. Rust stays the
 *        authority (there is no local countdown here, no setInterval, no
 *        second copy of the deadline), but its ticks correct a running
 *        animation instead of replacing one. A seek is skipped entirely unless
 *        the two disagree by more than DRIFT_MS, so ordinary tick jitter costs
 *        nothing and a genuine correction still lands. This is the same
 *        anchor-and-interpolate shape as app/pill/use-elapsed.ts, which is the
 *        established answer in this codebase for "backend owns the clock, the
 *        view owns the frames".
 *
 *        Drawn with transform: scaleX rather than width so the drain is a
 *        compositor job and costs no layout, which matters because it runs
 *        inside the pill while an audio thread is live. Linear, and it stays
 *        linear under prefers-reduced-motion: it is a clock, and an eased
 *        clock lies about how much time is left (docs/04 §6).
 * WHERE: The pill's cancel-armed state (docs/04 §7). Height is
 *        --countdown-line-height; its WIDTH is whatever slot it is given, so it
 *        occupies exactly the space the waveform it replaces did.
