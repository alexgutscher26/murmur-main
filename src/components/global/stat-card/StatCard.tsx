/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: StatCard, StatCardProps, StatDelta, StatTone,
 *   StatCardSize, TONE_CLASS, tabular-nums
 * WHAT:  One measurement: a label, a value, an optional delta, and a slot for
 *        a chart or sparkline beneath it.
 * WHY:   No surface of its own by default. Content sits on the material, and a
 *        card-on-glass is the fastest way to make this look like a Vista widget
 *        (docs/04 §2) — pass surface only where a stat genuinely needs to
 *        detach from what is behind it. The value is tabular-nums because a
 *        number that reflows as its digits change reads as cheap, and stats
 *        update live. Tone is opt-in rather than derived from the sign: the app
 *        has one accent by design, so a green number has to be a deliberate
 *        statement about state, not an automatic consequence of arithmetic.
 *        At hero size the delta drops to its own line. Hung off the baseline of
 *        a 40px number it has to be read as part of that number, and it is not —
 *        it is the sentence explaining where the number came from. At default
 *        size it stays inline, because next to a 22px value it reads as an
 *        annotation rather than as a caption fighting for the same line.
 * WHERE: The stats view — one hero card (time saved plus the activity chart)
 *        and the 2×3 grid — and the latency panel. The chart slot takes any
 *        element; there is no chart library in this app (docs/04 §11).
