/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: SettingDef, SettingKind, ToggleSetting, SelectSetting,
 *   NumberSetting, TextSetting, HotkeySetting, CustomSetting, SettingOption, HotkeyCapture
 * WHAT:  The declarative shape a settings row is rendered from — a discriminated
 *        union on `kind`, plus the option and hotkey-capture types.
 * WHY:   The Rust registry is the single source of truth for what the app has,
 *        and settings UI is generated from it (CLAUDE.md §7). So the union
 *        branches on `kind` and never on a feature name: adding a setting is a
 *        registry entry, and a new *kind* of control is the only thing that
 *        should ever require touching this file. A hotkey reports both its
 *        display string and the structured capture, because the glyphs are a
 *        display concern and the registry needs the real key and modifiers.
 * WHERE: Consumed by SettingControl.tsx and controls.tsx. Will be produced by
 *        the generated registry mirror in lib/registry.ts.
