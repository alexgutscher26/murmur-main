 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: global-components-barrel, GlassPanel, StatCard,
 *   DataList, SettingControl, EmptyState, ErrorSurface, ErrorBoundary, ProgressBar, Skeleton,
 *   CountdownRing, Waveform, Keycap, ShortcutsModal, ChangelogModal
 * WHAT:  The global component library — every primitive reusable across routes.
 * WHY:   One import path for the whole set, so a route never reaches into a
 *        component folder and no two routes disagree about where a primitive
 *        lives (CLAUDE.md §7, §8). Anything used by a single route belongs in
 *        that route's _components/ instead, and does not appear here.
 * WHERE: Imported by app/dashboard, app/pill and app/onboarding.
