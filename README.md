# Murmur

Press a key, talk, press it again — your words are on the clipboard and pasted
before you can look up.

Local-first speech to text for Windows and macOS. No account, no subscription, no word cap,
and no audio ever leaves your machine.

---

## What it does

- **Global hotkey** — ⌥Space (macOS) / Alt+Space (Windows) anywhere. Toggle, or hold-to-talk.
- **Transcribes while you speak**, not after you stop, so finishing is as fast
  after a five-minute monologue as after a five-second one.
- **Pastes into whatever had focus**, and puts your clipboard back afterwards.
- **Escape to cancel**, with a three-second countdown. Press Escape again and
  the recording resumes with nothing lost.
- **99 languages**, auto-detected or pinned.
- **A custom dictionary** for the names and jargon the model gets wrong — used
  both to bias recognition and to correct the output.
- **Searchable local history**, so a failed paste is never a lost thought.
- **Honest stats**, including the p50/p95 latency the app actually achieves.

Everything runs on your machine. The only network requests Murmur ever makes are the
first-run model download and an optional update check, and both are visible and
both can be turned off.

## Requirements

- **macOS**: macOS 13 or later, Apple Silicon (Metal-accelerated) or Intel
- **Windows**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- ~600 MB of disk for the default model

## Running it

```bash
pnpm install   # or bun install
pnpm tauri dev # or bun run tauri dev
```

### Windows Development & Performance

On Windows, Whisper C++ inference in debug builds can take up to ~20 seconds per segment without dependency optimization. `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` includes:

```toml
[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 3
```

This compiles all native dependencies (including `whisper-rs-sys` and `rubato` resampler) with full optimizations even during `tauri dev`, bringing real-time factor down from `>1.0x` (slow) to `<0.3x` (instantaneous).

First launch opens setup: grant the microphone, download the model, and test the
hotkey. After that Murmur lives in the system tray / menu bar and you will not see a window
again unless you open one.

## Building a release

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The bundle lands in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` — a `.app`, a `.dmg`,
and an updater archive.

**Signing the updater archive.** Because a public key is configured, Tauri also
signs the update artifact, and it needs the matching private key:

```bash
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.murmur-updater.key)" \
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="" \
  pnpm tauri build
```

Both variables are required. Setting the key without the password makes Tauri
prompt for one interactively, which fails in any non-interactive shell with a
misleading "incorrect password" error — the password is empty, it simply had no
way to tell you so.

Without either, the `.app` and `.dmg` still build correctly and only the update
artifact goes unsigned. In CI both come from repository secrets.

> **Back that private key up somewhere you will still have in five years.**
> It is the only thing that can sign an update. If it is lost, every existing
> installation is permanently stranded on whatever version it has — there is no
> recovery, because the public key is compiled into the apps already out there.

## Permissions, and what happens without them

| Permission | Needed for | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| Microphone | Recording | Murmur cannot record. Required. |
| Accessibility | Pasting for you | Everything still works — text goes to the clipboard instead. |

macOS shows each of these prompts **once per app**. If you dismiss one, the
dialog never comes back, so Murmur takes you straight to the right System
Settings pane instead of asking again.

### If Accessibility keeps forgetting you granted it

macOS keys permission grants to the bundle id **plus the code signature**.
Builds here are ad-hoc signed, which produces a new signature every time, so
**every rebuild looks like a different app** and the Accessibility grant is
lost. Pasting silently degrades to clipboard-only and nothing explains why.

That is a development annoyance, not a bug, and it does not affect a released
build. If you are rebuilding often, create one self-signed code-signing
certificate in Keychain Access and sign every build with that same identity —
the signature then stays stable and macOS stops forgetting. `docs/03 §3.4` has
the detail.

## For developers

The architecture is documented in `docs/`, and `CLAUDE.md` is the rulebook.
Start with `docs/00-START-HERE.md`; read `docs/06-CONVENTIONS-AND-GREP.md`
before writing your first file, because navigation here works through a
comment-based search index rather than by reading the tree:

```bash
pnpm sot SessionState      # which files own this symbol
pnpm sot:show AudioChunk   # the same, with each file's header
```

Two ideas carry the codebase. **The registry** (`src-tauri/src/registry/`) is one
table describing every feature — adding an entry wires up its settings UI,
permission preflight, nav placement, hotkey and metrics at once. **The command
factory** (`src-tauri/src/ipc/factory.rs`) is the single function every IPC call
passes through, so validation, permissions, reentrancy, tracing and error
mapping have one implementation instead of one per handler.

Types cross to TypeScript through `tauri-specta`: `src/lib/bindings.ts` is
generated by `cargo test` and must never be hand-edited.

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml   # also regenerates bindings
pnpm typecheck
```
