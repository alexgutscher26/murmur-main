## Core Reliability & Habit Formation (Activation & Daily Habit)

> Goal: ensure every user has a "first wow" within 5 minutes and builds a daily dictation habit within 7 days.

- [x] [UX] 5-minute "first wow" onboarding flow: mic permissions -> model weight download -> first in-app dictation test without opening external editors.
- [x] [WIN] Push-to-talk reliability: dedicated low-latency keyboard hook with modifier tap/hold detection (Alt+Space / Option+Space).
- [x] [WIN] Non-conflicting shortcut handler: suppress system menu conflict (WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_KEYMENU) when target focus is Win32.
- [x] [UX] Safe microphone status: live audio level visualization in floating pill + instant silence warning.
- [x] [UX] Fast audio error recovery: auto-reopen stream on device switch within 500ms before failing session.
- [x] [FEAT] Low-end hardware presets: downloadable Tiny & Base Q5_0 quantizations for budget laptops without dedicated GPUs.
- [x] [FEAT] Interruption & backtracking correction: detect voice backtracks ("no wait", "scratch that") and scrub previous segment in memory before injection.
  - Detect phrase variants: "no wait", "scratch that", "delete that", "undo", "never mind", "cancel that", "forget it"
  - Identify the segment boundary and remove only the corrected span, not the whole transcript
  - Re-arm automatically after the cancel command so the user can continue
  - Show a brief pill flash ("Removed last segment") as confirmation
- [x] [UX] First-run interactive dictation tutorial: guided step-by-step practice dictating a messy thought into a clean formatted email or commit.
  - Step 1: speak a short messy sentence (fillers allowed)
  - Step 2: show before/after transformation with the post-processing rules
  - Step 3: demonstrate paste into a dummy text field inside the onboarding window
  - Step 4: show the history entry and the WPM summary
  - Skip button that marks tutorial complete and never shows again
- [x] [UX] Habit-formation streak tracker: show a daily streak counter in the dashboard header as a low-pressure retention nudge.
  - Only count days with at least 3 successful sessions or 100 words dictated
  - Milestone badges at 7, 30, 90, and 365 days
  - Streak calculated from session timestamps in SQLite — no external dependency
- [x] [UX] Re-engagement prompt: if 3+ days pass with zero sessions, show a soft notification with a one-tap re-activation shortcut.
  - Show as Windows toast, not an in-app modal
  - Respect system Do Not Disturb state
  - Max one prompt per 7-day idle window to avoid spam
- [x] [FEAT] Adaptive onboarding re-entry points: if user skips onboarding mid-way, resume from the last completed step rather than restarting.
  - Persist onboarding step index in registry
  - Show a "Resume Setup" card in the dashboard for users with incomplete onboarding
- [x] [PERF] Sub-100ms hotkey-to-recording latency: profile and reduce the gap between keydown event and first audio sample captured to under 100ms.
  - Instrument with `tracing::span!` from keydown in the keyboard hook to first AudioData event
  - Target: p99 under 100ms on a mid-range 2022 laptop without GPU

## Windows-Specific

- [x] [BUG] [WIN] Text injection fails in elevated-privilege apps (e.g. Task Manager, regedit). SendInput is blocked by UIPI when the target process runs at a higher integrity level. Need UAC elevation detection and a graceful fallback message.
- [x] [BUG] [WIN] Clipboard not restored when target app does a fast Ctrl+V itself — arboard sets the clipboard, a race with the target app's own paste listener can clear it before Ctrl+V fires. Investigate using SetClipboardData with a delayed-render owner.
- [x] [BUG] [WIN] Alt+Space conflicts with the Windows system menu shortcut (WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_KEYMENU) in some legacy apps. Should detect when the app receiving focus is a Win32 window and optionally suppress the system menu.
- [x] [BUG] [WIN] Sound adapter uses MessageBeep (modal) — PlaySound with SND_ASYNC | SND_MEMORY would be non-blocking and allow custom WAV assets.
- [x] [WIN] [FEAT] DirectML / CUDA backend for Whisper — whisper.cpp has CUDA and DirectML build options. On NVIDIA/AMD GPUs this would bring realtime_factor well below 0.1. Add a GPU detection step during onboarding and expose a "Use GPU acceleration" toggle in settings.
- [x] [WIN] [FEAT] Windows Accessibility API injection — For apps that block SendInput + clipboard, implement IUIAutomation::SetFocus + ITextProvider::InsertText as a secondary delivery method.
- [x] [WIN] [FEAT] Windows Hello / Credential Manager integration — Store encryption keys for any future audio export in Windows Credential Manager rather than AppData.
- [x] [WIN] [UX] Windows 11 notification toasts — Replace tray-only feedback with Windows.UI.Notifications toast cards for transcription delivery and errors.
- [x] [WIN] [UX] System tray context menu keyboard navigation — Current menu is click-only; add keyboard shortcuts for open dashboard, pause, quit.
- [x] [WIN] [INFRA] MSIX packaging — Build an MSIX bundle (alongside the current NSIS installer) for distribution through the Microsoft Store and enterprise MDM.
- [x] [WIN] [INFRA] Fix pnpm tauri build on Windows — [EPERM] on node_modules/.bin/tauri.EXE unlink fails when Bun lockfile-cached binary is in use. Investigate switching to bun tauri build exclusively or adding a pre-build script that kills stale handles.
- [x] [WIN] [PERF] WASAPI exclusive-mode capture — Current CPAL setup uses shared mode (WASAPI shared), which adds ~10 ms of audio latency. Exclusive-mode gives sub-millisecond capture latency at the cost of stealing the device; expose as an advanced setting.
- [x] [WIN] [PERF] Promote [profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3 to the project README so other Windows contributors don't hit 20-second Whisper decode times in debug builds.
- [ ] [WIN] [FEAT] Raw Input hook for mouse push-to-talk — Register WM_INPUT on a hidden HWND so mouse button 4/5 can trigger dictation even when a game or fullscreen app has mouse focus captured.
  - Use RegisterRawInputDevices with HID_USAGE_PAGE_GENERIC and HID_USAGE_GENERIC_MOUSE
  - Parse RI_MOUSE_BUTTON_4_DOWN / RI_MOUSE_BUTTON_5_DOWN from RAWMOUSE.usButtonFlags
  - Forward to the same session actor event as keyboard push-to-talk
- [ ] [WIN] [FEAT] Dark mode tray icon variants — Ship two tray icon assets (light and dark) and switch based on SystemUsesLightTheme registry key.
  - Poll the registry on WM_SETTINGCHANGE with lParam == L"ImmersiveColorSet" to detect theme switches at runtime without restarting
- [ ] [WIN] [PERF] Low-latency audio path via WASAPI event-driven mode — Switch from the current callback-polling model to IAudioClient::SetEventHandle + a dedicated high-priority thread (SetThreadPriority(THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL)) to reduce jitter below 2ms.
- [ ] [WIN] [UX] Per-monitor DPI awareness v2 — Declare PerMonitorV2 in the app manifest so the pill and dashboard scale correctly when dragged across mixed-DPI displays (e.g. laptop 200% + external 100%).
- [ ] [WIN] [BUG] Tray icon disappears after Explorer crash — Register a TaskbarCreated message handler (RegisterWindowMessage(L"TaskbarCreated")) and re-add the tray icon when Explorer restarts.
- [ ] [WIN] [SEC] Memory-safe clipboard clear on lock — On WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE with WTS_SESSION_LOCK, zero out the clipboard if it contains a Murmur-set value using EmptyClipboard() followed by CloseClipboard().
- [ ] [WIN] [INFRA] ARM64 Windows build — Add an aarch64-pc-windows-msvc target to the release CI matrix for Snapdragon X Elite / Surface Pro devices.
  - Validate whisper.cpp compiles with MSVC on ARM64 (requires CMake flag -DWHISPER_BLAS=OFF and possible NEON SIMD adjustments)
  - Add a GitHub Actions runner with windows-arm64 runner label once available, or use cross-compilation from x86_64 with QEMU

---

## Audio Capture & VAD

- [x] [BUG] CPAL stream error on device switch — When Windows switches the default audio device (e.g. plugging in headphones), CPAL reports AudioDeviceLost. The session actor sends DeviceLost, which currently terminates the session. Instead, attempt to reopen the stream on the new default device within 500 ms and send ArmingFailed only if that also fails.
- [x] [FEAT] Per-session audio device locking — Once arming succeeds, pin the capture to that specific device for the session's lifetime so that Windows default device changes mid-sentence do not interrupt recording.
- [x] [FEAT] Multiple microphone support — The INPUT_DEVICE setting key exists but is not surfaced in onboarding. Wire up device enumeration in the UI: show a dropdown of available WASAPI input endpoints with their friendly names.
- [x] [FEAT] Speaker diarization — For multi-speaker environments, integrate a speaker-tracking build and prefix each paragraph with a speaker label.
- [x] [FEAT] Background noise profile — Capture a 1-second ambient baseline at session start and subtract it from subsequent chunks to improve VAD accuracy in noisy rooms.
- [x] [FEAT] Adjustable VAD sensitivity — Expose earshot VAD threshold as a user-visible setting (slider from Sensitive to Aggressive) so users in noisy environments can tune how much silence is trimmed.
- [x] [PERF] VAD-gated chunking — Only submit a chunk to the ASR worker if the VAD reports speech in it; currently interior chunks with only silence still go through engine.transcribe() which does a digital-silence fast-path but still allocates.
- [x] [PERF] Streaming / partial transcription display — Feed intermediate Whisper beam outputs back to the pill UI every 1-2 seconds so users see a live partial transcript instead of waiting for the tail decode. Requires whisper.cpp partial-decode callback support.
- [x] [UX] Waveform visualizer in the pill — Show a live audio waveform during recording using CaptureEvent::Level data already emitted so the user can see the mic is picking up their voice.
- [x] [UX] Silence warning — If peak_amplitude == 0.0 for more than 1 second, show a brief "No microphone signal detected" error inside the pill rather than silently failing.
- [x] [UX] Auto-detect mono vs stereo — If the user's mic sends stereo, down-mix to mono before feeding Whisper to avoid stereo-channel phasing artifacts.
- [ ] [FEAT] Noise gate with adaptive threshold — Automatically learn the ambient noise floor during the first 500ms of each session and apply a dynamic gate so whispers do not get clipped.
  - Use an exponential moving average over CaptureEvent::Level values
  - Gate threshold = noise_floor_ema * 1.5 (configurable multiplier in advanced settings)
  - Show gate threshold on the audio level meter as a faint horizontal line
- [ ] [FEAT] Push-to-talk recording limit — Add a configurable max_recording_seconds cap (default 120s) after which recording auto-finalizes to prevent accidentally leaving the mic open.
  - Show a countdown in the pill during the last 10 seconds
  - Play a soft chime at the auto-stop point
  - Make the cap configurable from 30s to unlimited in advanced settings
- [ ] [FEAT] Audio playback for quality review — After each session, allow the user to re-listen to their own recording (opt-in, stored locally, auto-purged per retention policy).
  - Requires a new opt-in "Save audio recordings" setting (off by default, clearly labeled as local-only)
  - Store as Opus at 16kHz mono in the session data directory
  - Delete audio file when the session is deleted or on retention purge
- [ ] [PERF] Ring-buffer audio pre-roll — Maintain a 500ms circular buffer before the hotkey fires so the first word (often captured while the mic is still opening) is not cut off.
- [ ] [PERF] Parallel VAD + accumulation — Run VAD on a separate thread from audio accumulation so the VAD decision does not block the capture callback and add latency.
- [ ] [BUG] Double-open mic on rapid hotkey press — If the user presses and releases the hotkey faster than the CPAL stream opens (~80ms), the session may arm twice. Add a mutex guard around the arming transition in the session state machine.

## Transcription Engine

- [x] [FEAT] DirectML encoder for Windows — The codebase has a coreml feature gate. Add a parallel directml gate that uses whisper.cpp's WHISPER_DIRECTML build to offload the encoder to the GPU, matching the macOS CoreML speedup.
- [x] [FEAT] Faster-Whisper / CTranslate2 backend — Implement a second TranscriptionEngine variant backed by faster-whisper via subprocess or Python FFI. At batch size 1, faster-whisper is 2-4x faster than whisper.cpp for the same model.
- [x] [FEAT] Online model registry — Instead of hard-coding model download URLs, fetch a models.json manifest from a CDN so new model releases appear in the UI without an app update.
- [x] [FEAT] Model download resume — If a model download is interrupted, resume from the last byte offset rather than starting over. reqwest supports Range headers.
- [x] [FEAT] Model integrity re-check on startup — Compute the SHA-256 of each model file at launch and compare to the stored hash. If corrupted, delete and re-download automatically.
- [x] [FEAT] Quantization options per model — For each model (e.g. large-v3-turbo), offer multiple quantizations: q4_0, q5_0, q8_0, f16. Show estimated size, speed, and quality trade-offs in the UI.
- [x] [FEAT] Parallel decode for interior chunks — Spawn a second ASR worker thread so interior chunks submitted while still recording can decode concurrently with the previous chunk, cutting overall latency on long dictations.
- [x] [FEAT] Whisper token timestamps — Enable token_timestamps = true in build_full_params and use per-word timestamps to build a word-level confidence map. Highlight low-confidence words in the history view.
- [x] [PERF] Persistent WhisperState across sessions — Currently states.acquire() creates a new state for each chunk. Reusing a single persistent state (resetting it between chunks) would save ~5 ms per chunk on allocation overhead.
- [x] [PERF] Thread count auto-tuning — decode_thread_count() is currently a fixed heuristic. Measure transcription speed during the prepare() warmup across 1-N threads and pick the fastest count automatically.
- [x] [BUG] Hallucination filter misses multi-sentence hallucinations — The blocklist drops a segment only when it is the entire segment text. Whisper sometimes emits "[BLANK_AUDIO] Thank you. [BLANK_AUDIO]" as one segment; the prefix/suffix noise bypasses the exact-match check. Add a strip-and-retry path.
- [ ] [FEAT] Whisper large-v3-turbo-q3_K_M quantization — Add a 3-bit quantization option for the large-v3-turbo model giving ~40% smaller footprint (~280MB) suitable for 8GB RAM devices, with a "Compressed" badge in the model picker.
- [ ] [FEAT] Custom vocabulary / hotword biasing — Pass a hotwords prompt to whisper.cpp's whisper_full_params.initial_prompt to bias toward user-defined technical terms, names, and brand words.
  - Read from the user's active dictionary and format as a comma-separated string
  - Cap at 224 tokens (whisper's context limit) and prefer high-frequency dictionary terms
  - Re-generate the prompt string when the dictionary changes without reloading the model
- [ ] [FEAT] Confidence-based word coloring — In the history detail view, shade low-confidence words (<0.7 probability) in amber so users can spot likely transcription errors at a glance.
- [ ] [FEAT] Language-pinned decode mode — Allow users to hard-pin the decode language in settings, bypassing auto-detect. This reduces p99 decode latency by ~15ms on short utterances where language detection adds overhead.
- [ ] [PERF] GGML memory-mapped model loading — Use mmap = true in whisper.cpp so the OS handles page-in lazily; this reduces cold-start model load from ~1.5s to ~300ms on SSDs by avoiding a full heap copy.
- [ ] [PERF] Encoder/decoder split threading — Pin the Whisper encoder to performance cores and the decoder to efficiency cores using Windows thread affinity masks, measured against the auto-tuning benchmark.
- [ ] [BUG] Model selector shows stale download progress after network error — The download progress bar stays at a non-zero value if the download errors out. Reset download_progress to 0 and show the error state in the model card on failure.
- [ ] [BUG] Empty segment after long silence — When the user holds the hotkey for >5s without speaking, Whisper decodes the silence and emits an empty or hallucination-only segment that passes through to delivery. Add a minimum-words guard (>=1 non-noise word) before triggering delivery.
- [ ] [DX] Model benchmarking CLI — A murmur-bench binary that accepts a WAV file and prints decode time, RTF, and WER against a reference transcript. Used by contributors to validate model changes without running the full app.

## Text Enhancement & Post-Processing

- [x] [FEAT] LLM post-processing pass — Add an optional pipeline step that sends the raw transcript through a local LLM (e.g. llama.cpp with a small 1B model) to fix grammar, remove fillers, and restructure run-on sentences. Toggle in settings.
- [x] [FEAT] Application-aware formatting — Detect the frontmost app via frontmost_app() and apply app-specific rules: e.g. in VS Code, auto-format code identifiers as camelCase; in Slack, trim trailing punctuation.
- [x] [FEAT] Custom substitutions / shortcuts — Let users define text expansions: "my address" to a full address. These would be stored in services/dictionary.rs and applied during the rules pass.
- [x] [FEAT] Per-language punctuation normalization — The NORMALISE_PUNCTUATION rule is language-agnostic. Apply locale-correct quote marks for French, German, etc. based on the detected language.
- [x] [FEAT] Spoken command expansion — Extend SPOKEN_COMMANDS beyond basic formatting to include insertion commands: "new line", "new paragraph", "open bracket", "close bracket", "delete last word".
- [x] [FEAT] Markdown mode — A toggle that reformats dictated text as Markdown: "heading level 2 best practices" becomes ## Best Practices, "bullet point foo" becomes - foo.
- [x] [FEAT] Email / message mode — Strip filler words and structure the output as a professional email draft with subject, greeting, body, and sign-off detection.
- [x] [FEAT] Named entity normalization — Detect proper nouns from the user's dictionary and apply their canonical capitalization (e.g. always correct "iphone" to "iPhone", "openai" to "OpenAI").
- [x] [FEAT] Correction learning — When the user edits a Murmur-typed string immediately after paste detected via accessibility APIs, record the before/after pair and auto-add it to the corrections dictionary.
- [x] [UX] Inline correction UI — After pasting, show a 3-second floating undo button ("Undo dictation") that restores the pre-paste clipboard content and removes the typed text.
- [ ] [FEAT] Smart sentence-boundary capitalization — Detect sentence boundaries based on pause duration (VAD silence > 400ms) and capitalize the first word of the new sentence automatically, even mid-session.
- [ ] [FEAT] Abbreviation expansion — "eg" to "e.g.", "ie" to "i.e.", "etc" to "etc.", "vs" to "vs.", with a per-language list. User-configurable opt-out per abbreviation.
- [ ] [FEAT] Number normalization — "forty two" to "42", "third" to "3rd", "one thousand" to "1,000". Handle ordinals, cardinals, and currency ("twenty dollars" to "$20").
- [ ] [FEAT] URL / path normalization — "https colon slash slash github dot com" to https://github.com. Detect and canonicalize spoken URLs, file paths, and email addresses.
- [ ] [FEAT] Code identifier casing pipeline — In code mode, detect compound words and apply the active casing style: "user profile component" to UserProfileComponent (PascalCase) or user_profile_component (snake_case).
- [ ] [FEAT] Post-processing rule priority ordering — Let users drag-and-drop the order in which enhancement rules execute. Persist order in registry as an ordered list of rule IDs.
- [ ] [FEAT] Rule preview sandbox — A text area in settings where users can paste raw transcript text and see how each enabled rule transforms it in real time, rule-by-rule, with a diff view.
- [ ] [FEAT] Profanity filter (opt-in) — Optional bleep/asterisk replacement of profanity, configurable per app profile (e.g. enable in Slack, disable in personal notes).
- [ ] [PERF] Rules pipeline caching — Cache the compiled regex patterns for filler words, corrections, and punctuation rules across sessions so they are not recompiled on every chunk.
- [ ] [BUG] LLM post-processing doubles certain punctuation — When both the Whisper model and the LLM post-processor add a period at the end of a sentence, the output has "word..". Fix by stripping trailing punctuation from the ASR output before feeding it to the LLM.

---

## Clipboard & Delivery

- [x] [BUG] Clipboard restore races with password managers — Some password managers (1Password, Bitwarden) monitor clipboard changes. When Murmur sets the clipboard and then restores it, some managers capture the interim transcript. Add a delay or use SetClipboardData with GMEM_DDESHARE to suppress clipboard history capture.
- [x] [FEAT] Delivery method: direct keyboard simulation — Instead of clipboard-paste, use SendInput with KEYEVENTF_UNICODE to inject text character-by-character. Slower but works in apps that disable paste (some security tools, game launchers).
- [x] [FEAT] Delivery method: Windows Accessibility API — IUIAutomation SetValue on the focused element as a third delivery tier for apps that support neither paste nor SendInput unicode.
- [x] [FEAT] Delivery confirmation — After paste, verify the text landed by reading the focused element's value via UIA and comparing. Surface a "Delivery failed" notification if it does not match.
- [x] [FEAT] Queue mode — A setting where transcription results are queued and delivered only when the user presses a separate "flush" hotkey, allowing multi-sentence dictation without interrupting typing.
- [x] [FEAT] Draft mode — Instead of pasting immediately, accumulate multiple recording sessions into a draft buffer. Show a floating mini-window with the accumulated draft and a "Send" button.
- [x] [UX] Paste delay calibration wizard — Detect the current system responsiveness and auto-suggest an optimal paste_delay_ms. Some apps (terminal emulators, Electron apps) need higher delays.
- [ ] [FEAT] Smart paste delay — Measure how long the frontmost app takes to respond to Ctrl+V during the onboarding calibration wizard and record a per-app paste_delay_ms override in the app profiles table.
- [ ] [FEAT] Delivery method: OLE Drag-and-Drop — As a fourth-tier fallback, simulate an OLE drag from a synthetic source into the focused element, which some sandboxed apps allow even when clipboard and SendInput are blocked.
- [ ] [FEAT] Clipboard history suppression on Windows 11 — Prevent the transcript from appearing in the Windows 11 clipboard history panel (Win+V).
  - Gate behind a "Suppress clipboard history" advanced setting (default: on)
  - Show a UI note explaining that this only prevents Windows clipboard history, not third-party managers
- [ ] [FEAT] Paste confirmation sound — A short, pleasant chime when delivery succeeds, distinct from the recording start/stop sounds. Configurable volume and on/off toggle.
- [ ] [FEAT] Auto-retry on delivery failure — If the UIA delivery confirmation step fails, automatically retry once with a 200ms delay before surfacing the error toast.
- [ ] [BUG] Draft mode does not persist across app restarts — The draft buffer lives only in memory. If the app crashes or is restarted, the accumulated draft is lost. Persist draft content to a dedicated `drafts` table in SQLite.
- [ ] [PERF] Unicode SendInput batching — Current character-by-character SendInput fires one INPUT struct per character. Batch up to 32 characters per SendInput call to reduce syscall overhead.

---

## UI — Pill

- [x] [FEAT] Real-time word count in pill — Show the live word count ("~12 words so far") in the pill to give the user feedback while speaking.
- [x] [FEAT] Animated recording indicator — Replace the static icon with a pulsing waveform or animated mic icon that reacts to the CaptureEvent::Level values.
- [x] [FEAT] Cancel confirmation — When the user presses Escape (cancel-arm), show a brief countdown in the pill ("Cancelling in 3...") with a "Keep recording" button to prevent accidental cancellations.
- [x] [FEAT] Partial transcript preview in pill — Show the last few decoded words in the pill as they come in from interior chunk decodes so the user can confirm the model is understanding them.
- [x] [UX] Pill position memory — Remember the last position the user dragged the pill to and restore it on next session, per-display.
- [x] [UX] Pill opacity setting — Let users dial the pill background opacity from 30%-100% for use on dark or busy backgrounds.
- [x] [UX] Pill size / compact mode — Offer a compact (icon-only) pill mode for minimal visual interruption.
- [x] [UX] Multi-display awareness — Show the pill on the same display as the frontmost window, not always the primary display.
- [x] [UX] Accessibility: screen reader announcements — Post a live region update via UIA when recording starts/stops so screen reader users get audio feedback.
- [ ] [FEAT] Pill right-click context menu — Right-clicking the pill during or after recording should show: "Copy transcript", "Open history", "Settings", "Dismiss". Implement as a native HMENU on Windows.
- [ ] [FEAT] Pill transcript scroll — When partial transcript text overflows the pill width, show a ticker-style horizontally scrolling text rather than truncation with ellipsis.
- [ ] [FEAT] Pill language indicator — When the session detects a non-default language, show a two-letter language code badge (e.g. "ES", "FR") in the pill corner.
- [ ] [FEAT] Pill recording timer — Show elapsed recording time in the pill so users can gauge how long they've been speaking.
- [ ] [UX] Pill haptic feedback (Windows) — If the device has a haptic actuator (Surface, modern laptops), send a light tap via Windows.Devices.Haptics on recording start and stop.
- [ ] [UX] Pill edge snapping — When dragged to within 20px of a screen edge, snap the pill to the edge and lock it there. Persist the edge preference alongside the position.
- [ ] [UX] Pill keyboard navigation — The pill should be fully focusable and operable via keyboard: Tab to reach it, Space to toggle recording, Escape to cancel, Enter to confirm. Never trap focus.
- [ ] [PERF] Pill render batching — The pill reacts to every CaptureEvent::Level event (60+ per second). Debounce redraws to 30fps to reduce GPU load on integrated graphics.
- [ ] [BUG] Pill disappears behind fullscreen apps — The pill's always_on_top flag does not work against DirectX exclusive-fullscreen windows. Investigate using SetWindowPos with HWND_TOPMOST inside a WM_ACTIVATE handler to re-assert top-most status when fullscreen apps steal exclusive mode.

---

## UI — Dashboard / Settings

- [x] [FEAT] History export — Export the full session history as CSV, JSON, or plaintext. Button in the History view.
- [x] [FEAT] History search — Full-text search across all recorded transcripts using SQLite FTS5. The search_sessions function stub exists in services/sessions.rs.
- [x] [FEAT] History bulk delete — Checkbox multi-select in History view with "Delete selected" and "Delete all" options.
- [x] [FEAT] Per-session playback — If audio recording is ever added (opt-in), allow playback of a session from the history view with word-level highlighting synchronized to timestamps.
- [x] [FEAT] Stats dashboard charts — Add line charts (words per day, sessions per week, average latency over time) using a lightweight charting library.
- [x] [FEAT] WPM baseline calibration wizard — Walk the user through reading a passage to measure their actual speaking rate and set BASELINE_WPM accurately.
- [x] [FEAT] App profile manager UI — The services/profiles.rs and ipc/commands/profiles.rs exist. Build a proper UI: list of app profiles, per-app overrides for language, mode, hotkey, and enhancement rules.
- [x] [FEAT] Settings import/export — Serialize all settings to a JSON file for backup or transfer to another machine.
- [x] [FEAT] Keyboard shortcut reference panel — A "Keyboard shortcuts" page in the dashboard listing all hotkeys and their functions.
- [x] [UX] Settings search — A search bar at the top of the Settings view that filters the setting list in real-time.
- [x] [UX] Dark / light / system theme — Add an explicit theme override in General settings.
- [x] [UX] Onboarding re-run — A "Run setup again" button in General settings to redo the microphone and hotkey test without reinstalling.
- [x] [UX] Fixed normal app window size (1000x660) — Enforce standard desktop dimensions on launch and refresh, prevent ballooning.
- [x] [UX] Tooltips on all advanced settings — Every advanced setting in the registry has a description; surface it as a hover tooltip next to the label.
- [ ] [FEAT] Session tagging — Let users tag sessions with labels ("meeting", "code review", "email") and filter history by tag. Tags stored as a many-to-many session_tags table in SQLite.
- [ ] [FEAT] Session favorites / pinning — Star a session to pin it at the top of the history view and exclude it from bulk delete and retention purge.
- [ ] [FEAT] History timeline view — An alternative calendar heatmap view of the history showing dictation activity by day. Click a day to see sessions from that day.
- [ ] [FEAT] Clipboard snapshot in history — When a session is delivered via clipboard, store a snapshot of the final delivered text separately from the raw transcript so the user can diff them.
- [ ] [FEAT] Quick re-dictate from history — A "Re-use" button on each history item that copies the final text back to the clipboard and pastes it into the current frontmost app.
- [ ] [FEAT] Session detail word timeline — Clicking into a session shows each word on a horizontal timeline with its timestamp offset from session start, color-coded by confidence.
- [ ] [FEAT] Keyboard-driven history navigation — Full arrow-key navigation in the history list, with Enter to expand a session and Delete/Backspace to delete the selected session, without mouse interaction.
- [ ] [UX] Onboarding progress sidebar — Show a persistent sidebar checklist during multi-step setup so users always know how many steps remain and can jump back to a completed step.
- [ ] [UX] Settings reset to defaults — A "Reset to defaults" button per section so users can undo a bad advanced settings change without wiping everything.
- [ ] [UX] In-app update notification badge — When a new version is available, show a badge on the dashboard header update icon rather than a blocking modal. The modal appears only when the user clicks the badge.
- [ ] [UX] Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) — A fuzzy-searchable command palette accessible from anywhere in the dashboard for navigation, actions ("Export history", "Calibrate WPM", "Open model manager"), and settings jumps.

## Hotkeys

- [x] [FEAT] Multiple hotkey bindings — Allow assigning two hotkeys (e.g. Alt+Space and a mouse button via raw input) so laptop and desktop workflows can each have a comfortable binding.
- [x] [FEAT] Per-app hotkey override — For apps that capture Alt+Space themselves (e.g. some games, terminals), allow a different hotkey to be used only when that app is frontmost.
- [x] [FEAT] Hotkey conflict detection — During registration, check if the requested hotkey is already registered by another app via RegisterHotKey return value on Windows and warn the user with alternatives.
- [x] [FEAT] Push-to-talk mouse button support — Let any mouse button (captured via raw input hook) act as the push-to-talk trigger.
- [x] [FEAT] Double-tap hotkey mode — Double-tapping the hotkey within 300 ms activates a "high-priority" session that skips the queue and pastes immediately.
- [x] [FEAT] Hotkey-to-command mapping — Allow additional hotkeys to trigger specific commands: e.g. Alt+Shift+Space = open dashboard, Alt+Escape = cancel and clear.
- [x] [BUG] [WIN] HOTKEY_HELD AtomicBool is process-global — If the app is ever extended to support multiple simultaneous recording modes (e.g. per-app sessions), a single global flag will not be correct. Refactor to a per-session or per-binding held-state tracker.
- [ ] [FEAT] Tap-to-toggle mode — An alternative to push-to-talk where a single tap starts recording and a second tap stops it. Configurable alongside push-to-talk in settings.
  - Show a visual toggle indicator in the tray icon and pill when in toggle mode vs PTT mode
  - Add a max session duration guard in toggle mode (default 5 minutes) to prevent runaway recordings
- [ ] [FEAT] Chord hotkeys — Support two-key chords (e.g. Ctrl+K, D for "dictate") for power users who want more ergonomic bindings that avoid system conflicts.
- [ ] [FEAT] Hotkey profile presets — Ship preset hotkey configurations: Minimal (Alt+Space only), Power User (four bindings), Gaming (mouse-only), Accessibility (single large key).
- [ ] [FEAT] Hotkey usage heatmap — Show a small keyboard graphic in the hotkey settings panel with usage counts per binding so users know which ones they actually use.
- [ ] [BUG] Hotkey stops working after fast user switch — Windows fast user switching can cause RegisterHotKey to fail silently when the session resumes. Detect resume via WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE with WTS_SESSION_UNLOCK and re-register all hotkeys.
- [ ] [BUG] Per-app hotkey override triggers for wrong window — The frontmost app detection for per-app overrides reads the active window at hotkey time. In some Alt+Tab scenarios, the HWND is still the previous window for ~50ms. Add a 30ms stabilization delay before reading the active window process name.

- [ ] [FEAT] Offline update bundle — Allow the user to manually point the updater at a local .msi/.exe file for air-gapped enterprise deployments.
  - File picker in General > Updates > "Install from file"
  - Validate signature before applying — reject unsigned bundles even in offline mode
  - Show installed version and the version from the bundle before confirming
- [ ] [INFRA] Signed Windows installer — The current build produces an unsigned NSIS installer. Obtain a code signing certificate and integrate `signtool.exe` into the CI build pipeline.
  - Use an EV code signing certificate (eliminates SmartScreen warning immediately)
  - Sign both the NSIS `.exe` and the MSIX bundle
  - Store the certificate in GitHub Actions secrets
- [ ] [INFRA] GitHub Actions Windows build — Add a `windows-latest` runner to the CI matrix that builds, signs, and uploads the Windows bundle as a release artifact.
  - Build both `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` targets

---

## Architecture & Reliability

- [ ] [INFRA] Crash reporter — Integrate `sentry-rust` or a local crash dump writer using `MiniDumpWriteDump` to capture panics and unhandled errors with a stack trace. Gate behind a user opt-in during onboarding.
  - If sentry-rust: use a self-hosted Sentry instance (no data leaves user control unless they opt in explicitly)
  - If local dump: write to `%APPDATA%\Murmur\crashes\` and offer to email/open the dump file from the next launch dialog
- [ ] [INFRA] Health-check endpoint — Expose a local HTTP endpoint (e.g. `localhost:PORT/health`) so OS-level monitoring scripts can verify Murmur is alive without the GUI.
  - Returns JSON `{ "status": "ok", "version": "0.1.0", "uptime_seconds": 3600, "sessions_today": 12 }`
  - Bind only to `127.0.0.1` — never expose externally
  - Port is randomized at first launch and stored in registry to avoid collisions
- [ ] [INFRA] Structured logging with log rotation — The current `tracing-appender` setup writes to a single log file. Add rolling file appender with size-based rotation and keep only the last 5 files.
  - Max file size: 10MB before rotation
  - Files named `murmur.log`, `murmur.log.1`, ... `murmur.log.5`
  - On startup, delete any rotated files older than 14 days
- [ ] [INFRA] Metrics export — Emit session latency, word count, and decode time metrics to a local Prometheus-compatible endpoint for power users who run local monitoring stacks.
- [ ] [DX] Integration test harness for Windows — The e2e tests in `session/e2e_tests.rs` mock audio. Add a real-audio integration test that captures from a virtual audio device (VB-Audio Cable or similar) on CI.
- [ ] [DX] Benchmark suite — A `cargo bench` target that runs Whisper on a fixed audio fixture and reports decode time. Gate CI failures on a regression threshold (e.g. +-15% from baseline).
- [ ] [DX] Database migration framework — Currently SQLite schema changes require manual version bumps. Add a migration runner (e.g. `rusqlite_migration`) that applies numbered `.sql` files at startup.
  - Migrations live in `src-tauri/src/migrations/`
  - Each migration is a file named `0001_initial.sql`, `0002_add_tags.sql`, etc.
  - The runner checks `PRAGMA user_version` and applies all missing migrations in order
  - Rollback is not supported; a failed migration panics with a clear error message pointing to the failing file
- [ ] [DX] Settings schema version — Add a `schema_version` row to the settings table so old settings can be migrated or deprecated cleanly across app versions.
- [ ] [DX] IPC contract tests — Auto-generate TypeScript types from the specta bindings and add a test that the generated `bindings.ts` matches the Rust side on every build.
- [ ] [INFRA] Plugin architecture — Extract delivery methods (clipboard, accessibility, keyboard) and enhancement rules into a plugin trait so third-party developers can add delivery backends without forking the core.
  - Define a `DeliveryPlugin` trait with `fn can_deliver(&self, target: &AppTarget) -> bool` and `fn deliver(&self, text: &str, target: &AppTarget) -> Result<()>`
  - Ship three built-in plugins: `ClipboardDelivery`, `SendInputDelivery`, `UIAutomationDelivery`
  - Load plugins from `%APPDATA%\Murmur\plugins\` at startup
- [ ] [INFRA] Graceful shutdown — On SIGTERM or window close, wait for any in-flight session to complete delivery before exiting. Current behavior drops the session if the user quits mid-dictation.
- [ ] [DX] Error code registry — Assign a unique error code to every `AppError` variant (e.g. `MRM-1001` for `AudioDeviceLost`) and document them in `docs/ERROR_CODES.md` so users can search for solutions.

- [ ] [PERF] Low-bandwidth / offline verification guide — Documented test suite confirming identical sub-200ms latency in air-gapped / airplane mode.
- [ ] [PERF] Memory usage regression gate — Add a `memory_usage_mb` assertion to the benchmark suite. Fail if peak resident memory during a 60-second session exceeds 800MB on the `small` model.
- [ ] [PERF] Cold start optimization — Profile and reduce time-to-ready (from app launch to first hotkey response). Target: under 3 seconds on a mid-range 2022 laptop SSD.
  - Measure with `tracing::span!` wrapping each bootstrap phase
  - Lazy-load non-critical bootstrap steps (update check, session recovery) after the hotkey is armed

## Integrations

- [ ] [FEAT] Browser extension — A Chrome/Edge extension that lets the dictation pill appear inside browser text fields without the clipboard round-trip, using the extension's input event injection API.
  - Extension communicates with the Murmur desktop app via the native messaging host API
  - The extension registers a background service worker that listens for transcript events from the native host
  - Inject text using `InputEvent` with `inputType: "insertText"` for maximum compatibility
  - Show a small Murmur icon in focused text fields as a visual affordance
- [ ] [FEAT] VS Code extension — Trigger Murmur from VS Code's command palette and have the transcript inserted at the cursor via the VS Code extension API (`editor.edit`).
  - Commands: `murmur.startDictation`, `murmur.stopDictation`, `murmur.cancelDictation`
  - Show a status bar item that pulses during recording
  - Subscribe to transcript events from the local WebSocket API
- [ ] [FEAT] REST / WebSocket API — Expose a local WebSocket server so third-party apps can subscribe to transcript events in real time (e.g. for streaming captions on OBS).
  - Endpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:{port}/events`
  - Events: `session_started`, `partial_transcript`, `session_completed`, `session_cancelled`
  - Authentication: a session token stored in registry, required in the `Authorization: Bearer` header on upgrade
  - Document with an OpenAPI 3.1 spec and a 10-line JavaScript client example
- [ ] [FEAT] AutoHotkey / PowerShell trigger — Document and expose a named pipe or local socket that external scripts can write to in order to start/stop sessions programmatically.
  - Named pipe: `\\.\pipe\MurmurControl`
  - Protocol: line-delimited JSON commands `{ "command": "start_session" }` / `{ "command": "stop_session" }`
  - Document in `docs/SCRIPTING.md` with 5 AutoHotkey v2 examples
- [ ] [FEAT] Whisper API compatibility layer — Expose a local HTTP endpoint that accepts audio files and returns transcripts in the OpenAI Whisper API format, so existing tools (Raycast, Obsidian plugins) can use Murmur as a local Whisper backend.
  - Endpoint: `POST http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1/audio/transcriptions`
  - Accept: `multipart/form-data` with `file` and optional `language`, `model`, `response_format` fields
  - Return: OpenAI-compatible JSON `{ "text": "..." }` or verbose JSON with word timestamps
  - Rate limit: 10 concurrent requests max to prevent VRAM exhaustion
- [ ] [FEAT] Obsidian plugin — A community Obsidian plugin that starts Murmur dictation from a ribbon icon or command palette and inserts the final transcript at the active cursor in the current note.
- [ ] [FEAT] Notion integration (webhook-based) — After a session, optionally POST the transcript to a user-configured Notion page via the Notion API. Authentication via a user-provided Notion integration token stored in Windows Credential Manager.
- [ ] [FEAT] Raycast extension (macOS) — A Raycast extension that surfaces a "Dictate with Murmur" command and shows the 5 most recent transcripts in a Raycast list view.
- [ ] [FEAT] OBS WebSocket caption overlay — When the local WebSocket API is active, provide a ready-to-import OBS source preset that displays the live partial transcript as a caption overlay during streams or recordings.

## Known Bugs & Tech Debt

- [x] [BUG] `modifier_tap.rs` uses `static mut` with mutable references — Refactored into safe `Mutex<SharedState>`, fully Rust 2024 compliant with zero `static_mut_refs` warnings.
- [x] [BUG] `PillMetrics.exit_ms` and `exit_travel` are dead code — Wired up animation accessor functions (`pill_exit_ms`, `pill_exit_travel`, `pill_width_compact`) in `tray.rs`.
- [x] [BUG] Updater endpoint 404 on dev builds — Added `TAURI_UPDATER_DISABLE=1` and debug mode checks in `bootstrap.rs` and `updates.rs` to prevent 404 endpoint errors on dev launches.
- [x] [BUG] Session orphan recovery runs before audio device is available — Added audio device readiness check before querying and recovering orphan sessions at startup in `bootstrap/recovery.rs`.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] `bootstrap.rs` is 2000+ lines — Modularized `bootstrap.rs` into clean submodules: `bootstrap/windows.rs`, `bootstrap/hotkeys.rs`, `bootstrap/engine.rs`, `bootstrap/recovery.rs`, `bootstrap/updates.rs`, and `bootstrap/mod.rs`.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] `registry/mod.rs` is 727 lines — Modularized capability and setting declarations into per-capability submodules under `registry/capabilities/`.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] `adapters/rules/text.rs` is 39 KB — Split the filler, correction, punctuation, whitespace, dictionary, and spoken command logic into dedicated modular files under `adapters/rules/` with a clean re-export and test facade in `text.rs`.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] No API versioning on IPC commands — Added API versioning contracts (`CURRENT_API_VERSION`, `MIN_COMPATIBLE_API_VERSION`, `ApiVersionInfo`) and registered `get_api_version` IPC command with Specta bindings to prevent frontend/backend drift.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] `tauri.conf.json` `resources: []` — Enhanced model bundling support with multi-directory fallback resolver checking Tauri resource directory and APPDATA models path so releases can bundle models cleanly.
- [x] [BUG] Tray tooltip shows stale WPM after a session with zero words — The `last_session_wpm` value in the tray tooltip is not reset when a session is cancelled or produces an empty transcript. Guard with `word_count > 0` before updating the WPM display.
- [x] [BUG] Settings page scroll position resets on every route navigation — The settings route unmounts and remounts on each tab switch, losing scroll position. Lift the scroll container outside the tab router or use a scroll restoration hook.
- [x] [BUG] History FTS search returns duplicate results when a session matches in both `raw_text` and `final_text` — The FTS5 virtual table joins against the sessions table without `DISTINCT`. Add `GROUP BY sessions.id` or use `SELECT DISTINCT` in `search_sessions`.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] IPC command handlers have inconsistent error logging — Some handlers log the error before returning it, some log after, some not at all. Standardize: the command factory should be the sole logger for all command-level errors.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] `services/sessions.rs` is approaching 500 lines — Pre-emptively split into `services/sessions/crud.rs`, `services/sessions/search.rs`, `services/sessions/stats.rs` before it hits the 400-line single-responsibility limit.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] No integration tests for the IPC command factory — The factory's validation, permission preflight, and reentrancy guard logic is only covered by unit tests on the factory itself. Add integration tests that call commands end-to-end through a test app handle.
- [x] [TECH DEBT] Hardcoded color values in `pill.html` — The pill HTML uses inline rgba color values that do not respect the app's design token system. Replace with CSS custom properties matching the design system tokens from `docs/04-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`.
- [x] [DX] Pre-commit hook for SOT keyword checks — Add a `pre-commit` hook that runs `pnpm sot:validate` and fails if any Rust file over 50 lines is missing a `SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS` header.
- [x] [DX] `cargo-deny` for supply chain security — Add `deny.toml` with `licenses` and `bans` sections to block GPL-incompatible dependencies and known-bad crate versions from entering the build.

## Accessibility

> Goal: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all in-app UI. The pill must be operable with keyboard and screen reader only.

- [ ] [UX] Full keyboard navigation in the dashboard — Every interactive element (button, input, tab, list item) must be reachable and operable without a mouse. Tab order must be logical and visible with a clear focus ring.
- [ ] [UX] High-contrast mode support — Test the dashboard and pill in Windows High Contrast mode (Aquatic, Desert, Dusk, Night Sky) and fix any elements that become invisible or unreadable.
- [ ] [UX] Screen reader session announcements — When a session starts, announce "Murmur recording started". When it ends, announce "Transcript delivered: [N] words". Use `aria-live="assertive"` for recording events and `aria-live="polite"` for delivery.
- [ ] [UX] Focus trap in modals — The settings modal, update dialog, and onboarding overlay must trap focus so Tab never escapes to the background content behind the overlay.
- [ ] [UX] Color-independent status indicators — All status indicators (mic level, delivery status, error states) must have a non-color cue (icon, text, or pattern) in addition to color so colorblind users get the same information.
- [ ] [UX] Minimum tap target size — All clickable elements in the pill and dashboard must be at least 44x44px to support motor-impaired users.
- [ ] [UX] Motion reduction support — Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. When set, disable all CSS transitions and animations and replace with instant state changes.
- [ ] [UX] Zoom support — Ensure the dashboard layout does not break at 200% browser zoom or Windows display scaling up to 300%.
- [ ] [DX] Automated accessibility audit in CI — Add `axe-core` (via Playwright) to the CI pipeline to catch regressions in ARIA roles, focus management, and color contrast automatically on every PR.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] [DX] End-to-end test suite with Playwright — Cover the critical user flows: onboarding, model download, first dictation, history search, settings export/import, and update installation.
  - Use Playwright's tauri driver or the local WebSocket API to drive dictation events from test scripts
  - Run on `windows-latest` and `macos-latest` GitHub Actions runners
- [ ] [DX] Property-based tests for text enhancement rules — Use `proptest` or `quickcheck` to fuzz the filler removal, punctuation normalization, and spoken command expansion rules with random inputs to catch edge cases.
- [ ] [DX] Golden file tests for the rules pipeline — Maintain a `tests/golden/` directory of input transcripts and expected outputs for each rule. These double as regression tests and documentation.
- [ ] [DX] Load test for the IPC command factory — Simulate 100 concurrent IPC calls to the transcription pipeline and verify that the reentrancy guard correctly serializes sessions and that memory does not grow unboundedly.
- [ ] [DX] Model download failure simulation — A test mode that injects HTTP errors (timeout, 404, partial download) into the model downloader to verify resume, retry, and error UI behavior.
- [ ] [DX] Audio fixture library — A curated set of WAV files (clear speech, noisy speech, silence, multi-speaker, non-English, code dictation) used as inputs across all audio pipeline tests.
- [ ] [DX] Snapshot tests for the dashboard UI — Use Storybook or Playwright screenshot tests to capture a pixel snapshot of each dashboard view and fail if the snapshot changes unexpectedly.
- [ ] [DX] Mutation testing — Run `cargo-mutants` on the session state machine and text enhancement rules to measure test effectiveness and identify untested branches.

## Documentation

- [ ] [DX] Architecture overview diagram — A Mermaid diagram in `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE.md` showing the full data flow from hotkey press to text injection, including all actors, ports, adapters, and services.
- [ ] [DX] `docs/00-START-HERE.md` — A new contributor guide explaining the layered architecture, SOT keyword system, how to find things with `pnpm sot`, and the 5-step workflow for adding a new feature (registry -> command -> service -> UI -> test).
- [ ] [DX] API reference for the WebSocket / REST API — An OpenAPI 3.1 spec in `docs/api/openapi.yaml` generated from the Rust types via a custom build step, with a rendered HTML version at `docs/api/index.html`.
- [ ] [DX] Contributing guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) — Setup instructions (Rust toolchain, Bun, system dependencies), code style rules (referencing CLAUDE.md), PR process, and how to run the test suite locally.
- [ ] [DX] Security policy (`SECURITY.md`) — How to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, the PGP key for encrypted reports, the expected response timeline, and a summary of the threat model.
- [ ] [DX] `docs/04-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` completeness audit — Verify every design token used in the codebase is documented in the design system file, and every documented token is actually used. Remove orphaned tokens.
- [ ] [DX] Changelog automation — A GitHub Actions workflow that drafts the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for each release by categorizing `git log` entries since the last tag into Added, Changed, Fixed, and Removed sections.
- [ ] [DX] In-app help docs — A searchable in-app help panel (accessible via `?`) that renders markdown from `docs/` at build time so users can look up features without opening a browser.

## Community & Ecosystem

- [ ] [COMMUNITY] Discord server — A public Discord community for Murmur users and contributors with channels for `#announcements`, `#feature-requests`, `#bug-reports`, `#showcase` (share your voice packs), and `#dev` (contributor discussion).
- [ ] [COMMUNITY] Community voice pack directory — A GitHub repository (`murmur-community/packs`) where contributors can PR their domain-specific voice packs (medical, legal, coding, creative writing) following a schema and review process.
- [ ] [COMMUNITY] Public feature roadmap — A public GitHub project board or `ROADMAP.md` showing the current quarter's planned features, in-progress items, and the next quarter's backlog, updated monthly.
- [ ] [COMMUNITY] User feedback widget — A subtle in-app thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback button visible after each session (never during) that stores the rating locally and batches it for optional opt-in submission.
- [ ] [COMMUNITY] Open beta program — A public beta channel where users can opt in to pre-release builds, with a dedicated `#beta-feedback` Discord channel and a structured feedback form linked from each beta release.
- [ ] [COMMUNITY] Contributor recognition — A `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file automatically updated by CI after each merged PR, listing contributors alphabetically with their contributions. Linked from the README and the About page in the dashboard.
- [ ] [DX] GitHub issue templates — Structured templates for Bug Report, Feature Request, and Security Vulnerability with required fields (reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, system info, Murmur version).
- [ ] [DX] GitHub PR template — A PR checklist template requiring: description of change, testing done, screenshots (for UI changes), and confirmation that SOT headers are present in new files.

## Mobile & Cross-Platform

> Long-term aspirational items. Not targeted for 2026.

- [ ] [FEAT] macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon) release — Official `aarch64-apple-darwin` build with Metal acceleration enabled by default. Requires CI runner with Apple Silicon (GitHub `macos-14` runner).
- [ ] [FEAT] Linux support (experimental) — An `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` AppImage build. Audio capture via PipeWire / ALSA. Text injection via `xdotool` or `ydotool` for Wayland.
- [ ] [FEAT] Android companion app (voice capture only) — A minimal Android app that captures audio and streams it to the desktop Murmur app via local Wi-Fi for dictation while away from the keyboard.
- [ ] [FEAT] iOS companion app — Same as Android: audio capture over local network, no cloud.
- [ ] [FEAT] iPad split-screen optimization — When running the companion app in iPad split-screen, show the pill in the companion app's view rather than the desktop.

## AI & Machine Learning Roadmap

> Next-generation capabilities. Requires research and validation before specification.

- [ ] [RESEARCH] On-device speaker identification — Explore a lightweight speaker embedding model (e.g. SpeakerNet, EcapaTDNN at <20MB) that can distinguish between 2-5 enrolled speakers without cloud processing.
- [ ] [RESEARCH] Continual learning from corrections — Investigate whether whisper.cpp supports fine-tuning from correction pairs, or whether a lightweight adapter (LoRA) layer can be trained incrementally on-device with <100 examples.
- [ ] [RESEARCH] Emotion-aware post-processing — Detect the emotional tone of the dictation (excited, tired, frustrated) from prosody features and adjust the enhancement style accordingly (e.g. add exclamation points for excited speech).
- [ ] [RESEARCH] Active noise cancellation pre-filter — Evaluate a real-time ANC model (e.g. RNNoise at 90KB) as a pre-filter before the VAD and Whisper encoder to improve WER in noisy environments by 10-20%.
- [ ] [RESEARCH] Personalized vocabulary fine-tuning — After the user has 500+ sessions, evaluate whether a vocabulary-biased prompt or a LoRA adapter trained on their correction pairs meaningfully reduces WER on their speech pattern.
- [ ] [FEAT] Multimodal context injection — Allow users to screenshot the current screen and pass it as context to the LLM post-processing pass, so the LLM can infer intent from the visual context (e.g. if a code file is visible, prefer code formatting).
- [ ] [FEAT] Voice cloning protection — Detect if the input audio is a synthetic voice clone (using a lightweight spoofing detection model) and refuse to transcribe it, protecting against replay attacks on voice-triggered systems.
