/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: reachability, every_setting_is_consumed,
 *   every_metric_is_recorded, DECLARATION_SITES, KNOWN_UNREACHABLE,
 *   consumption_site
 * WHAT:  Asserts that every setting the registry declares is READ by something,
 *        and every metric it declares is RECORDED by something. Reads the
 *        crate's own source at test time and looks for a consumption site.
 * WHY:   Our other guardrails check STRUCTURE — that a key resolves, that the
 *        table has no duplicates, that a value round-trips through SQLite.
 *        None of them check REACHABILITY, and a registry entry can pass every
 *        one of them while being read by nobody: it generates a control, the
 *        control saves, the value comes back, and the app's behaviour never
 *        changes. The user has told us something and been agreed with.
 *
 *        That is not hypothetical. Two independent audits of this crate landed
 *        on the same shape and it accounted for every High finding between
 *        them: `privacy.retention_days` promising "older transcripts are
 *        deleted automatically" with `purge_older_than` correct and uncalled;
 *        `general.launch_at_login` writing a row nothing acts on; the two paste
 *        delays whose own doc comment claimed they were "built from settings by
 *        pipeline/deliver.rs", a file that does not exist; and four declared
 *        metrics — including TotalFinalize, the number the product promises —
 *        that nothing ever recorded.
 *
 *        A grep-the-source test is crude, and crude is the point: it fails for
 *        a reason anyone can check by hand in ten seconds, and it cannot be
 *        satisfied by a mock. The alternative — trusting a reviewer to notice
 *        an absence — is what produced the list above.
 * WHERE: Compiled into the crate's tests by registry/mod.rs.

 *        display order.
 *
