/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: CAPABILITIES, capabilities, capability,
 *   setting_def, default_settings, nav_items, hotkey_defs, all_settings,
 *   validate_registry, RegistrySnapshot
 * WHAT:  The single source of truth for what this app has. One table of
 *        capabilities, plus the lookups every other layer uses to read it.
 * WHY:   A feature is an entry here, never a new pattern. Adding one wires up
 *        its settings UI, its permission preflight, its nav placement, its
 *        hotkey and its metrics at once, because all five read this table
 *        instead of keeping their own copies. The rule that follows from it:
 *        if you are writing a `match` on a feature name anywhere outside this
 *        module, the branch belongs in the table instead.
 *
 *        Built through LazyLock rather than as a `const`, because the entries
 *        hold owned Strings and Vecs. That is deliberate — the same structs
 *        cross to TypeScript through specta unchanged, so the frontend reads
 *        the identical table rather than a hand-maintained mirror of it.
 * WHERE: Read by ipc/factory.rs (preflight), services/settings.rs (defaults and
 *        validation), the Settings view (control generation), the dashboard
 *        shell (nav) and the hotkey adapter (bindings).

 *        at runtime — a duplicated key means one setting quietly shadows
