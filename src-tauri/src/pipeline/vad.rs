 * WHAT:  Voice activity detection over the 16kHz mono stream: tracks whether

 * WHY:   Two jobs, and only two. It decides WHERE a chunk boundary goes, and it
 *        gates silent audio out before it ever reaches the model. Both are
 *        low-accuracy tasks, which is why a pure-Rust WebRTC-style detector is
 *        the right tool — no ONNX runtime, no second model to download, no
 *        first-run compile.
 *
 *        The gate is the more important of the two. Whisper reliably INVENTS
 *        text when handed silence — "Thank you.", "Please subscribe", subtitle
 *        credits — because its training data was subtitled video. Never sending
 *        it a silent chunk removes most of that failure class at the source,
 *        which is far better than trying to filter the output afterwards.
 * WHERE: Driven by pipeline/chunker.rs, which asks it where the boundaries are.

 *        single 16ms blip satisfied. This asks how MUCH of the chunk was voice,
 *        which is the question that distinguishes a beep from a sentence.
 *
 *        120ms is deliberately low — well under the shortest real utterance
 *        ("no" runs 200-300ms) — because the two errors are not symmetrical.
 *        Letting a beep through costs the user a spurious word they can delete.
 *        Dropping a chunk costs them something they SAID, and they may never
 *        find out which words went missing. When the two are in tension the
 *        answer is to let the beep through, so this number buys only the
 *        margin that is free.
 *
 *        Sustained noise — a fan, an air conditioner — is NOT what this catches.
 *        A WebRTC-style detector scores broadband noise as voice for as long as
 *        it runs, so no duration rule can reject it. That case is caught after
 *        the model instead, by no_speech_probability in the whisper adapter.
