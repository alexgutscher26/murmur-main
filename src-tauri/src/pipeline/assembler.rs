/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: Assembler, push_segments, finish, join_overlapping,
 *   MAX_SEAM_WORDS, normalise_word
 * WHAT:  Joins the segments decoded from successive chunks into one transcript,
 *        removing the duplication the deliberate chunk overlap creates.
 * WHY:   The join has to be done on TEXT, not on timestamps, and that is a
 *        consequence of a decision made elsewhere: timestamp tokens are
 *        disabled for speed, so a chunk returns ONE segment spanning the whole
 *        chunk with no sub-chunk resolution. The spans are truthful but too
 *        coarse to locate a repeated word in, so anything that tried to
 *        de-duplicate by comparing times would find the segments merely
 *        adjacent and silently do nothing.
 *
 *        The overlap is ~200ms, which is at most a word or two. The search is
 *        bounded accordingly — a longer window would start "finding" overlaps
 *        in ordinary repeated speech and delete words the user actually said,
 *        which is far worse than leaving a duplicate in.
 * WHERE: Fed by pipeline/worker.rs as chunks complete; its output goes to the
 *        TextEnhancer.
