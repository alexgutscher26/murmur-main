/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: install_tray, TrayMenu, MENU_DASHBOARD,

 * WHAT:  The menu bar item: the only permanently visible part of Murmur, and
 *        the only way to reach the dashboard.
 * WHY:   The app has no Dock icon and no window on launch — it is invisible
 *        until summoned, which is the product. That makes this the sole
 *        affordance, so it has to carry everything a user needs: open the
 *        dashboard, and quit.
 *
 *        `show_dashboard` does more than call `show()`, and the extra step is
 *        not optional. With LSUIElement set, the process is an accessory: a
 *        window it shows does NOT come to the front and cannot take keyboard
 *        focus properly. Without an explicit activation the dashboard opens
 *        behind whatever the user was doing and feels broken.
 * WHERE: Installed once during bootstrap.
