/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: MIGRATIONS, Migration, apply_migrations,
 *   schema_version, SCHEMA_VERSION
 * WHAT:  The ordered list of schema migrations and the runner that applies the
 *        ones this database has not seen.
 * WHY:   `PRAGMA user_version` is the whole mechanism — no migration framework,
 *        no metadata table, nothing to keep in sync. Each migration runs inside
 *        a transaction WITH the version bump, so a failure halfway through
 *        leaves the database on the previous version rather than in a state
 *        that is neither. Migrations are embedded with include_str! so a
 *        shipped binary can never disagree with the SQL it was built from.
 * WHERE: Run once by db/connection.rs when the connection is opened.
