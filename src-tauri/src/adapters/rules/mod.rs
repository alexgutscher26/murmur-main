/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: RuleEnhancer, enhance, RULE_ORDER, text
 * WHAT:  The deterministic TextEnhancer: applies the rules in text.rs in a
 *        fixed order.
 * WHY:   The ORDER is the design, and it is not arbitrary:
 *          1. whitespace first, so every later rule can assume single spaces;
 *          2. spoken commands next, because they INSERT punctuation that later
 *             rules then need to tidy and capitalise after;
 *          3. fillers before the dictionary, so a filler cannot sit inside a
 *             phrase the dictionary is trying to match, and spoken corrections
 *             straight after them so a stray "um" cannot separate a slip from
 *             the correction that replaces it;
 *          4. the dictionary before stutter removal, so a corrected term is
 *             what gets compared for repetition;
 *          5. punctuation, then casing, then the terminal stop — casing depends
 *             on sentence boundaries existing, and the terminal stop must come
 *             last or it would be capitalised as a new sentence.
 *
 *        Every rule is individually toggleable through EnhanceContext, and the
 *        whole pass is measured in microseconds — it runs inside the finalize
 *        budget, so anything expensive here is spending the product's headline
 *        promise.
 * WHERE: Implements the TextEnhancer port; called by pipeline/deliver.rs.
