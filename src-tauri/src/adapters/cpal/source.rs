/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: CpalAudioSource, CpalCaptureSession, build_stream,
 *   spawn_drain, RING_CAPACITY_FRAMES, DRAIN_INTERVAL
 * WHAT:  Microphone capture: opens a CoreAudio input stream, copies samples out
 *        of the realtime callback through a lock-free ring buffer, and converts
 *        them to 16kHz mono on a normal thread.
 * WHY:   The whole shape of this file exists to protect one rule: **the cpal
 *        input callback runs on a CoreAudio realtime thread, and inside it we
 *        may not allocate, lock, log, touch the database, or call anything
 *        async.** Violating that does not crash — it produces dropped buffers
 *        and glitches that look exactly like a transcription accuracy problem,
 *        which is how you spend a day debugging the wrong layer.
 *
 *        So the callback does precisely one thing: copy samples into a
 *        lock-free SPSC ring buffer. Everything expensive — format conversion,
 *        downmix, resampling, metering, channel sends — happens on the drain
 *        thread, where it is allowed to be slow.
 *
 *        A device disappearing mid-sentence is treated as a normal event, not
 *        an edge case. AirPods disconnect. The error callback reports it as
 *        CaptureEvent::Lost and whatever was already captured stays valid and
 *        gets delivered — losing a sentence to a headset is exactly the failure
 *        history exists to prevent.
 * WHERE: Implements the AudioSource port; driven by pipeline/capture.rs.
