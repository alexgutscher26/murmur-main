 *   NO_SPEECH_THOLD, ENTROPY_THOLD
 * WHAT:  Builds the `FullParams` for one decode, and computes the encoder
 *        context size from the fragment length.
 * WHY:   Whisper's encoder always runs over a 30-second mel window, so a 1.2s
 *        tail costs the same as a 25s chunk unless `audio_ctx` is shrunk to fit
 *        the actual audio. That single value is the difference between a ~1.4s
 *        final decode and a sub-200ms one, which is the whole p50 < 300ms
 *        budget. It is applied to the TAIL ONLY: reduced context can cost
 *        accuracy, and interior chunks decode in the background where their
 *        latency is invisible, so they keep the full 1500.
 *        `temperature_inc = 0.0` disables whisper's temperature-fallback loop —
 *        up to six extra decode passes fired without warning, turning a 200ms
 *        decode into 1.4s. `no_context = true` stops decoder state carrying
 *        across chunk boundaries, which is the cause of "it repeated the same
 *        sentence forty times".
 * WHERE: Called by adapters/whisper/engine.rs for every transcribe; the values
 *        come from docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md §2.1 and §2.2.
