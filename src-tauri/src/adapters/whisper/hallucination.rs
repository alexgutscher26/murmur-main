 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: is_hallucination, normalise_for_match,
 *   is_digital_silence, SILENCE_PEAK_FLOOR, LIKELY_SILENCE_NO_SPEECH_PROB,
 *   LIKELY_SILENCE_RMS_DBFS, rms_dbfs
 * WHAT:  The two guards that stand between a silent buffer and the words
 *        "Thanks for watching!" appearing in the user's document.
 * WHY:   Whisper invents text from silence, and the inventions are a small,
 *        well-known set of subtitle strings baked in by training-data
 *        contamination. The rule that makes a blocklist safe rather than
 *        destructive is that a phrase is dropped ONLY when it is the entire
 *        segment — "thank you" mid-sentence is a real thing people say, and an
 *        editor that deletes it has broken dictation to fix a cosmetic bug.
 *        The riskiest entries are short ones a person might genuinely utter
 *        alone, so those carry a second condition: the chunk must also have
 *        been too quiet to be speech. That qualifier is measured from the audio
 *        rather than taken from whisper's `no_speech_probability`, because
 *        that field reads 0.000 on this build even for text invented over a
 *        -70 dBFS buffer — see LIKELY_SILENCE_NO_SPEECH_PROB.
 * WHERE: Applied by adapters/whisper/engine.rs to every decoded segment; the
 *        phrase table itself lives in blocklist.rs. The
 *        primary VAD gate that stops most of this lives upstream in
 *        pipeline/vad.rs. Rules from docs/03-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md §2.4.

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: SILENCE_PEAK_FLOOR, is_digital_silence
 * WHAT:  Peak amplitude below which a buffer is treated as containing nothing.
 * WHY:   Deliberately set at digital silence (-80 dBFS) rather than at a noise
 *        floor. This is a last-resort backstop, not the VAD: a real microphone
 *        in a quiet room sits far above it, so this can only ever reject a
 *        buffer that is genuinely empty — a dropped device, a muted input, a
 *        zero-filled fragment. Raising it to something that "works better"
 *        would start eating quiet speech, which is the failure this guard is
 *        supposed to be too dumb to cause.
 * WHERE: Checked in engine.rs before the model is invoked at all.

 *        can never fire, which is why the real qualifier below is measured from

 *        below anything a person talking into a microphone produces and
 *        comfortably above a room's noise floor, so it separates the two cases
 *        without a judgement call.
