/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: HttpModelStore, ensure, verify, status, list,
 *   delete, ProgressEmitter, verified_cache, CONNECT_TIMEOUT
 * WHAT:  The ModelStore implementation: a static catalog plus whatever is on
 *        disk, with resumable, hash-verified, atomically-installed downloads.
 * WHY:   No path leaves this file without a hash behind it — a truncated 574MB
 *        model passes an existence check and then fails deep inside inference,
 *        where the error is indistinguishable from a corrupt install.
 *
 *        But the GATE and the QUERIES are not the same job, and conflating
 *        them cost 4.5 seconds of the first screen a user ever sees. `ensure`
 *        is the gate: it hashes, always, because it hands a path to the engine.
 *        `list` and `status` are UI queries — they answer "what have we got",
 *        they never hand out a path, and they must never be where half a
 *        gigabyte is read. They report from the cached verdict plus cheap
 *        filesystem evidence, and a present file whose hash has not run is
 *        `Verifying`, never `Ready`: reporting a guarantee before checking it
 *        is the exact failure the hash exists to prevent.
 *
 *        The cache holds the VERDICT, not just the successes. A file that
 *        hashed wrong is as much a fact as one that hashed right, and without
 *        the negative a corrupt file of exactly the right size would report
 *        `Verifying` forever, with nothing left to verify it.
 *        Install is a rename from `.part` in the same directory, which is
 *        atomic on APFS: there is no instant at which the model path holds a
 *        partially written file.
 * WHERE: Constructed by adapters/mod.rs::build_model_store; driven by
 *        onboarding and the model manager through the ModelStore port.

     *        the warm-up starts during `setup`, and onboarding's Download button
     *        appears immediately after.
     *
     *        Two concurrent `download_resumable` calls compute their resume
     *        offset from the same `.part` length and then both append to it. The

     *
     *        The lock lives HERE rather than being fixed by reordering
     *        bootstrap, because the factory's guard is per-process-per-command
     *        and cannot see a background thread. A resource that two unrelated
     *        callers can open has to defend itself. This is also what makes the

 *        hashing correctly first — and re-deriving it on every launch cost 6.5
 *        seconds of an engine that is supposed to be warm before the first
 *        hotkey. Size and mtime are stored so the marker can be invalidated by
 *        the file changing, which is the only event that can make the recorded
 *        digest wrong.
 *
 *        This is deliberately NOT protection against a hostile edit that
 *        preserves both: anyone able to write into the application support
 *        directory has better attacks available, and the model manager's
 *        explicit re-verify exists for the case where someone genuinely

     * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: gate_serialises_the_same_model
     * WHAT:  Two callers asking for the same model share one lock; two callers
     *        asking for different models do not.
     * WHY:   This is the mechanism that stops bootstrap's engine warm-up thread
     *        and onboarding's Download button downloading the same 574MB file
     *        into the same `.part` at the same time — which interleaves the
     *        bytes, fails the SHA-256, and tells the user their download was
     *        "damaged in transit" when nothing was damaged.
     *
     *        Asserted on the lock itself rather than by racing two real
     *        downloads: a test that needs the network to reproduce a race is a
     *        test that passes for the wrong reason on a bad day. The per-model
     *        half matters just as much — one global lock would make a small
     *        model queue behind a large one, and someone would remove it.
