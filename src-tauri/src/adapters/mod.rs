/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: adapters, build_engine, build_model_store,
 *   available_engines, WHISPER_ENGINE_ID, default_engine_id
 * WHAT:  Barrel for every third-party integration, and the factory that
 *        constructs exactly one implementation per port.
 * WHY:   Construction is centralised so "only the selected adapter is ever
 *        built" is enforceable rather than aspirational — a second engine
 *        loaded speculatively would hold a second 1.1GB model resident, which
 *        on an 8GB machine is the whole app. The factory returns the trait
 *        object and nothing else: callers branch on `capabilities()`, never on
 *        which arm was taken, which is what keeps adding an engine to one arm
 *        here and one new directory below.
 * WHERE: Called from the app bootstrap in lib.rs; the trait objects it returns
 *        are consumed by pipeline/ and ipc/.
