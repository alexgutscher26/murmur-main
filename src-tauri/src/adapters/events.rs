/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: TauriEventSink, EventSink, emit, pill_visibility
 * WHAT:  The EventSink implementation that pushes typed events to the windows
 *        and shows or hides the pill.
 * WHY:   This is the only place in the app that knows both the domain's
 *        vocabulary and Tauri's. Keeping it in adapters/ means `session/` can
 *        be compiled, reasoned about and tested without a UI framework in
 *        scope — and it means a second frontend, or none at all, is a new
 *        adapter rather than a change to the recording logic.
 *
 *        Every emit failure is logged and swallowed. A window that has closed
 *        mid-session is normal, and turning that into an error the actor has to
 *        handle would put UI lifecycle concerns inside the state machine.
 * WHERE: Constructed in bootstrap and handed to the session actor.
