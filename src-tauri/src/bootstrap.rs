/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: bootstrap, setup, build_ports, spawn_actor,
 *   register_hotkeys, prepare_engine, recover_orphans, show_first_run
 * WHAT:  Everything that has to happen once at launch: resolve paths, open the
 *        database, construct the adapters, start the session actor, register
 *        the global hotkey, and warm the model.
 * WHY:   This is the ONLY file that names a concrete adapter. Everything else
 *        in the app is written against ports, so swapping an engine or moving
 *        to Windows changes this file and one directory under adapters/, and
 *        nothing else.
 *
 *        Ordering here is not arbitrary. The model is warmed on a background
 *        thread AFTER the windows exist, because loading it costs ~1.5s and
 *        doing that before the UI appears makes a fast app look slow. But it
 *        must complete before the first hotkey press, which is why it starts
 *        immediately rather than lazily — a cold load on the hotkey path is
 *        the single worst first impression this app could give.
 * WHERE: Called from lib.rs `run`.

 *
 *        Worth knowing when reading this: macOS attributes a grant to the
 *        RESPONSIBLE process, which for a binary launched from a terminal is
 *        the terminal, not the app. So a build launched by hand from a shell

 * WHY:   Tauri destroys a window when it is closed, and a destroyed window
 *        cannot be shown again — `get_webview_window` returns None from then
 *        on. So closing the dashboard did not merely put it away: it removed
 *        the app's ONLY window permanently, and the tray item that exists to
 *        reopen it silently did nothing for the rest of the session. Dictation
 *        kept working, which made it look like the window had broken rather
 *        than gone.
 *
 *        Hiding is also the correct macOS behaviour independently of the bug.
 *        Closing a window is not quitting an app; for a menu-bar utility with
 *        no Dock icon it is simply putting the window away, and Quit in the
 *        tray remains the one way to actually stop Murmur.
 *

 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: start_retention_sweep, retention_days, purge
 * WHAT:  Applies `privacy.retention_days` — at launch, and every six hours
 *        after that for as long as the app is running.
 * WHY:   The setting says "Older transcripts are deleted automatically". Until
 *        this existed nothing anywhere called `purge_older_than` except an IPC
 *        command the frontend never invoked, so the sentence was false: the
 *        control rendered, the value saved, the value came back, and every
 *        transcript was kept forever. In an app whose entire pitch is that your
 *        speech never leaves the machine, a privacy control that does nothing
 *        is the worst kind of bug — the user has been told they are protected.
 *
 *        Both halves are needed. Launch-only would never fire for someone who
 *        leaves Murmur running for weeks, which is the intended way to use a
 *        menu-bar utility. Timer-only would never fire for someone who quits
 *        every evening.
 *
 *        The setting is re-read on every sweep rather than captured once, for
 *        the same reason `updates_enabled` re-reads: a cached retention window
 *        is a deletion the user has already cancelled, or one they have asked
 *        for and will not get until they restart.
 *
 *        Takes the History reentrancy guard, exactly as the IPC path does. A
 *        background job that deletes rows while an export is walking them is
 *        the race the guard exists to prevent, and being a timer rather than a
 *        command does not exempt it. A skipped tick is free — the next one is
 *        six hours away and the cutoff will have moved by seconds.
 * WHERE: Started once by setup, after the database is open.

 * WHAT:  Makes the pill visible over full-screen apps and on every Space.
 * WHY:   `alwaysOnTop` sets a window LEVEL, which orders windows within a
 *        Space and says nothing about which Spaces a window belongs to. A
 *        full-screen app gets a Space of its own, and by default our pill is
 *        not in it — so dictating into a full-screen editor showed no pill at
 *        all, while swiping back to the desktop revealed it sitting there
 *        faithfully over nothing.
 *
 *        That is a serious failure for this product specifically: the pill is
 *        the ONLY feedback that recording started, the app has no other window
 *        on screen, and full screen is exactly where someone writing prose
 *        works. Silence there reads as the hotkey not firing.
 *
 *        Three behaviours, each load-bearing:
 *          canJoinAllSpaces     — belong to every Space, including a
 *                                 full-screen app's own.
 *          fullScreenAuxiliary  — allowed to sit ABOVE full-screen content
 *                                 rather than being pushed behind it.
 *          stationary           — do not slide with the Spaces swipe
 *                                 animation, which would smear a floating
 *                                 indicator across the transition.
 *
 *        The level is raised to the status-item level as well, which is where
 *        menu-bar overlays live — floating is enough within a Space and is not
 *        reliably above full-screen content.
 *
 *        Deliberately only the pill. The dashboard and onboarding are ordinary
 *        windows and should follow ordinary Space rules; a settings window that
 *        followed you into every full-screen app would be an intrusion.

 *
 *        The UI used to re-check on window focus. That is the obvious answer

 *        NO window on screen when the switch is flipped, so there is no focus
 *        event to hang it on. The operator's report was exactly this — grant it,
 *        come back, and the app still says it is missing.
 *
 *        Polling is the honest mechanism rather than a workaround: both checks
 *        are cheap local calls (AXIsProcessTrusted, and an AVFoundation status
 *        read that does not touch the device), and there is no event to
 *        subscribe to. It emits only on CHANGE, so a stable machine costs one
 *        comparison a second and no IPC at all.
 *
 *        It keeps watching after everything is granted, at a slower cadence,

 *        which is the bug this replaces. `attach_sidebar` runs during setup —
 *        before `show_first_window` has placed and centred the dashboard — so
 *        reading its position then returns coordinates it does not have yet.
 *        The rail was pinned to that stale origin and the dashboard then moved
 *        out from under it, which put the rail ON TOP of the window instead of
 *        beside it. It looked like a layout mistake and was a timing one.
 *
 *        Vertically CENTRED rather than top-aligned because the rail is a
 *        widget hanging beside the app, not a second column of it — the thing
 *        it is modelled on floats against the middle of the window's edge.
 *
 *        Only the initial placement is ours. Once the parent moves, AppKit
 *        carries the child at a fixed offset, which is exactly why this is a
