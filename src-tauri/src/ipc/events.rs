/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: SessionStateChanged, AudioLevelChanged,
 *   ModelDownloadProgress, OnboardingProgress, emit_state, TypedEvent
 * WHAT:  Every event Rust pushes to the frontend, as typed structs.
 * WHY:   Rust owns domain state and PUSHES it. The frontend never polls and
 *        never keeps a second copy — so the pill cannot show a state the
 *        machine has already left, which is the failure a polling design
 *        produces under load. Declaring events as types means specta generates
 *        the listener signatures too, so a renamed field breaks the TypeScript
 *        build instead of silently delivering undefined.
 * WHERE: Emitted by session/actor.rs and the model store; consumed by
 *        src/lib/events.ts.

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: TranscriptDelivered
 * WHAT:  A recording finished its journey — the text has been pasted or copied.
 * WHY:   Delivery no longer ends when the session state machine does, so the
 *        state stream can no longer tell anyone that words arrived. Anything
 *        that needs to know a delivery actually SUCCEEDED — as opposed to a
 *        recording merely having stopped — has to hear it here.
 *
 *        Onboarding is the case that proves it is needed rather than
 *        convenient: its hotkey step is deliberately completed by observing a
 *        real delivery rather than by a button the user clicks, because that is
 *        the only evidence that the shortcut registered, the microphone opened,
 *        the model ran AND the paste worked. Without this event that step would
 *        have had to settle for "a recording stopped", which is exactly the
 *        weaker assertion it was written to avoid.
 * WHERE: Emitted by session/delivery.rs at the end of every delivery.

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: PermissionsChanged
 * WHAT:  The OS grants, pushed whenever one of them actually changes.
 * WHY:   A permission is granted in System Settings — a DIFFERENT app — and
 *        nothing in our process is told. The UI used to re-check on window
 *        focus, which is the obvious answer and is not enough: Murmur is an
 *        accessory app that often has no window on screen at all when the
 *        switch is flipped, and the operator reported the app never noticing
 *        even after quitting and relaunching.
 *
 *        Pushing it means the moment the switch moves, every window that cares
 *        is correct — no focus, no restart, no reopening a pane to "refresh"
 *        it. That last part is what he was actually complaining about.
 * WHERE: Emitted by the watcher in bootstrap; consumed by lib/use-permissions.

 *        download installing, and a removal. `list_models` is a fetch-once, so

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: SettingsChanged
 * WHAT:  Announces that a setting was written or reset.
 * WHY:   More than one window reads settings — the dashboard, the pill and

 *        event each one keeps whatever it last fetched, so rebinding the hotkey
 *        in Settings leaves the pill rendering the old keycap indefinitely.

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: UpdateAvailable
 * WHAT:  A newer signed build exists.
 * WHY:   The `general.check_updates` setting promises a check "on launch and
 *        once a day", and until this event existed nothing delivered it —
 *        `check_for_update` and `install_update` were registered, exported, and
 *        called by nobody. A control that describes a schedule the app does not
 *        run is a control that lies.
 *
 *        Pushed rather than polled, like every other state in this app: the
 *        scheduler in bootstrap decides when to look, and the UI learns the
 *        answer whenever it arrives. A frontend that polled would have to own
 *        the schedule, and then the setting would describe one place while
 *        another did the work.
 * WHERE: Emitted by bootstrap's update scheduler; consumed by the dashboard,
 *        which offers the Update action that calls `install_update`.
