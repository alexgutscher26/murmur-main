 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: specta_builder, export_bindings, collect_commands,
 *   collect_events, BINDINGS_PATH
 * WHAT:  The one place every command and event is registered with specta, and
 *        the export that writes src/lib/bindings.ts.
 * WHY:   This is the app's tRPC analog: Rust signatures generate the TypeScript
 *        client, so there are no DTOs, no hand-written IPC types, and a renamed
 *        Rust field breaks the frontend build instead of arriving as undefined
 *        at runtime.
 *
 *        The export runs as a TEST rather than a build script on purpose.
 *        A build script would regenerate bindings on every compile — including
 *        release builds on a machine that has no frontend checked out — and a
 *        manual step would drift. As a test it runs with `cargo test`, so CI
 *        fails if the checked-in bindings do not match the Rust.
 * WHERE: The builder is mounted in lib.rs; the generated file is consumed by
 *        every frontend module that talks to Rust.
