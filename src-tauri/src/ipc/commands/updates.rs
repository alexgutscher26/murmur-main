/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: check_for_update, install_update, UpdateCheck,
 *   updates_enabled, CHECK_UPDATES, UpdaterExt, updater_disabled
 * WHAT:  The two update commands: ask GitHub Releases whether a newer signed
 *        build exists, and install one.
 * WHY:   This is the ONLY network request Murmur makes after setup, and the
 *        product promise is that it can be switched off — so the setting is
 *        checked BEFORE the updater is ever constructed, in both commands.
 *        Not before the request: before the client exists. A gate that builds
 *        a network client and then declines to use it is one refactor away
 *        from being no gate at all.
 *
 *        `install_update` re-runs the check rather than reusing the handle
 *        `check_for_update` obtained. An `Update` cannot cross the IPC
 *        boundary, so the alternative is parking one in AppState and hoping
 *        the version the user clicked is the version still sitting there. The
 *        second check costs one request and removes that whole class of
 *        mismatch — and it is the request that matters, because it is the one
 *        whose signature is verified before anything is written to disk.
 *
 *        Signature verification itself is the plugin's, keyed by the public
 *        key in tauri.conf.json. Nothing here reimplements it, and nothing
 *        here can bypass it.
 * WHERE: Registered in ipc/bindings.rs; driven by the Settings view's update
 *        section. The signing side is .github/workflows/release.yml.

 *        user turned this off" is not the same answer as "there is nothing new"
 *        and the UI must not render them the same way. Collapsing them is how
