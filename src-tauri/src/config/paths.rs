 * WHY:   One place decides where things live, so nothing can disagree about
 *        where the database is. Resolved at startup and carried in state rather
 *        than recomputed at each call site, because a path computed twice is a

 *        to one location and looked for in another is a bug that presents as a
 *        574MB re-download.
