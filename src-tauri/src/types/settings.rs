     * WHY:   Two different ways a binding can be saved and then never work, and
     *        both were reachable from the settings UI:
     *
     *        1. **Modifier-only.** The user asked for Option on its own. A bare
     *           modifier cannot be a global hotkey here and should not be one.
     *           Mechanically, the plugin's API is `Shortcut::new(modifiers,
     *           code)` — a chord, not a key monitor — so there is nothing to
     *           register. More importantly it would be wrong even if it were
     *           possible: Option is held constantly to type accented characters
     *           and as a modifier in every app, so binding it means Murmur
     *           starts recording while you type. Detecting a tap-and-release of
     *           a lone modifier means a CGEventTap on flagsChanged, which is a
     *           different mechanism, needs Accessibility, and still fires on a
     *           mistimed keystroke. Refused, with a sentence saying why.
     *
     *        2. **A key the app cannot map.** Anything outside the set the
     *           hotkey adapter knows how to convert. Saving one is the failure
     *           this codebase keeps finding in new costumes: the row is written,
     *           the Settings view and the pill re-read it and draw the NEW
     *           keycap, and the OS is holding nothing at all. The app displays a
     *           key that does nothing.
     *
     *        Lives on the type rather than in the command, so the rule is stated
     *        once next to the shape it describes and both the validator and any
     *        future caller get the same answer. The set of bindable keys is
     *        cross-checked against the hotkey adapter's own mapping by
     *        `every_bindable_key_maps_to_a_real_code`, so the two cannot drift.
     * WHERE: ipc/commands/settings.rs validation; mirrored as an instant hint by
     *        the capture control, which must never be the authority.
