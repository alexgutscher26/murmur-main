/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: DictionaryEntry, MatchKind, DictionaryId
 * WHAT:  One custom vocabulary replacement.
 * WHY:   The dictionary is deliberately used twice: its terms are fed to the
 *        engine as a recognition prompt AND applied as a post-hoc replacement.
 *        Replacement alone cannot repair a term the model heard as something
 *        unrelated, and prompting alone does not catch every miss — so the
 *        entry carries what both layers need.
 * WHERE: Stored by services/dictionary.rs; consumed by the whisper adapter's
 *        prompt builder and by the replacement rule in adapters/rules.

 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: MatchKind

 * WHY:   Whole-word is the default because substring matching silently corrupts
 *        unrelated words — a replacement of "ai" would rewrite "said".
 * WHERE: On every DictionaryEntry.
