/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: TextEnhancer, EnhanceContext, EnhanceRule,
 *   RuleId, enhance
 * WHAT:  The trait that turns a raw transcript into text that reads like
 *        writing.
 * WHY:   Blocking and expected to be sub-millisecond, because the deterministic
 *        rule pipeline runs inside the finalize budget. The seam exists so a
 *        local-LLM rewrite can be dropped in later as a different implementation
 *        — that one costs 200-500ms, which is exactly why it must be opt-in and
 *        must not be able to sneak onto this path unnoticed.
 * WHERE: Implemented by adapters/rules; called by pipeline/deliver.rs after the
 *        segments are joined.

/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: EnhanceContext
 * WHAT:  Everything the rules need besides the text.
 * WHY:   Passed in rather than read from settings inside the enhancer, so every
 *        rule is a pure function of its inputs and therefore table-testable.
 *        That test suite is the cheapest accuracy guard in the project.
 * WHERE: Built by pipeline/deliver.rs from settings, the active app profile,
 *        and the dictionary service.
