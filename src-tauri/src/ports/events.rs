/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: EventSink, session_state_changed, audio_level,
 *   set_pill_visible, NullEventSink
 * WHAT:  The trait the domain uses to push state outward.
 * WHY:   Two reasons, and the first is a rule this codebase enforces on
 *        everything else:
 *
 *        1. **Layering.** `session/` is domain code. Before this port existed
 *           it imported `tauri` directly and called `emit` on an AppHandle —
 *           an upward dependency from the domain into the boundary, which is
 *           exactly what CLAUDE.md §3 forbids and what makes a codebase
 *           impossible to move. The domain now says WHAT happened; the adapter
 *           decides how it reaches a window.
 *
 *        2. **Testability.** The session actor is where the interesting
 *           correctness lives — cancellation, seams, delivery — and none of it
 *           could be tested without constructing a Tauri app. With this seam an
 *           end-to-end test drives the real actor, the real chunker and the
 *           real engine, and simply records what came out.
 *
 *        Deliberately fire-and-forget: no method returns a Result. A window
 *        that has closed is not a failure the domain can act on, and making the
 *        actor handle an emit error would put UI concerns back inside it.
 * WHERE: Implemented by adapters/events (Tauri) and by the recording fake in
 *        the end-to-end tests. Consumed by session/actor.rs.

     *        resolves it runs somewhere else entirely, on the background

     *        "Verifying" forever: a spinner that never lands, which is a worse
     *        lie than the stall it replaced.

     *        is recorded or a model is removed.

     *        everywhere — closing a dialog, leaving a field, exiting vim — for
