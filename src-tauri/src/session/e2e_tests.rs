/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: e2e_session, ReplayAudioSource, RecordingEventSink,
 *   CapturingInjector, run_session, speech_wav
 * WHAT:  End-to-end tests that drive the REAL session actor — real chunker,
 *        real VAD, real Whisper engine, real enhancement rules, real database —
 *        with recorded audio replayed through a fake microphone.
 * WHY:   Everything else in this crate tests one layer. These test the thing
 *        the product actually promises: that pressing a key, speaking, and
 *        pressing it again produces correct text, persists a row, and records
 *        its own latency. Every bug worth shipping-blocking lives in the SEAMS
 *        between those layers, and no unit test can see a seam.
 *
 *        Only three things are faked, and each for a reason that is not
 *        convenience:
 *          - the microphone, because a test cannot speak;
 *          - the injector, because a test must not paste into whatever window
 *            happens to have focus on the machine running it;
 *          - the event sink, because there is no UI — and it doubles as the
 *            recording of what the pill would have been told.
 *        The engine is NOT faked. If Whisper stops producing words, these fail.
 *
 *        They self-skip when the model is absent, so a clean checkout stays
 *        green — a suite that is red for an environmental reason is a suite
 *        people learn to ignore.
 * WHERE: The last line of defence before a release.
