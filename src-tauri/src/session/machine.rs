 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: SessionMachine, SessionEvent, Transition, Effect,
 *   TransitionError, handle, current_state, cancel_countdown_ms, CancelPending,
 *   CancelArmed, CancelAborted, CancelExpired, DestroySession
 * WHAT:  The finite state machine governing one recording session. Pure: it
 *        takes an event, returns the new state plus a list of effects, and
 *        performs none of them.
 * WHY:   Recording state lives in exactly one place, so illegal states are
 *        unrepresentable and every transition is logged. Purity is the point —
 *        the machine touches no database, no audio device and no clock, which
 *        is what makes "kill the process in state X and assert recovery"
 *        something a unit test can express rather than something you find out
 *        about from a user.
 *
 *        Effects are DATA, returned for the actor to perform. That separation
 *        is what lets the ordering guarantee be checked: the persist effect is
 *        emitted before the state is considered live, so a crash mid-transition
 *        leaves a recoverable row rather than a state nobody wrote down.
 *
 *        The one asymmetry worth knowing: cancellation does NOT stop capture.
 *        Audio keeps flowing through CancelPending, because nothing being torn
 *        down is exactly what lets a second Escape resume with no gap.
 * WHERE: Owned by session/actor.rs, which is the only thing allowed to drive
 *        it. Its state is pushed to the pill as a typed event.
