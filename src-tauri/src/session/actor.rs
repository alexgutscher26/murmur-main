/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: SessionActor, run, apply_effect, handle_capture,
 *   handle_decode, finalize, EVENT_QUEUE_DEPTH, TICK_INTERVAL
 * WHAT:  The single task that owns the recording FSM and performs its effects.
 *        Everything else sends it messages.
 * WHY:   One owner, reached only by a bounded channel — never an
 *        `Arc<Mutex<SessionState>>` shared between the audio drain, the ASR
 *        worker, the hotkey handler and the IPC layer. That shape is how you
 *        get a deadlock which reproduces once a week at 2am and cannot be
 *        reproduced on demand. Here the state has exactly one owner, so the
 *        deadlock is structurally impossible rather than merely avoided.
 *
 *        The FSM itself stays pure: it returns effects as DATA and this file is
 *        the only thing that performs them, in the order returned. That
 *        separation is what lets the ordering guarantee — persist the row
 *        before the microphone opens — be asserted by a unit test rather than
 *        hoped for.
 * WHERE: Spawned once during setup in lib.rs. Driven by ipc/commands/session.rs,
 *        the hotkey handler, and the capture and decode channels.
