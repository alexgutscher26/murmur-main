/*!
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: DeliveryWorker, PendingDelivery, FinishedRecording,
 *   run_delivery_worker, ordered_delivery, background_delivery
 * WHAT:  Everything that happens to a recording AFTER the user has stopped
 *        talking: the trailing decode, enhancement, the paste, the History row.
 * WHY:   This module exists so that none of it happens while the user is
 *        waiting. Capture and delivery used to be one state machine, which
 *        meant the person was held at the machine's pace — the pill stayed on
 *        screen for as long as the model took, and the next recording was
 *        refused until the previous one had finished pasting. Splitting them at
 *        the stop boundary is what makes the app feel immediate: the FSM is
 *        back at Idle before the tail has even been submitted.
 *
 *        DELIVERIES ARE SEQUENTIAL, and that is the second reason this is a
 *        module rather than a detached task per recording. If two recordings
 *        are in flight, their text MUST arrive in the order it was spoken —
 *        dictate a sentence, dictate the next, and getting them back reversed
 *        is worse than waiting. A single consumer reading one channel gives
 *        that ordering by construction, with no locking and nothing to reason
 *        about. Spawning a task per delivery would have been simpler to write
 *        and would have raced two pastes into the same text field.
 *
 *        It also means a slow decode delays only the deliveries behind it,
 *        never the microphone.
 * WHERE: Fed by SessionActor when a recording finishes; runs as one task
 *        spawned alongside the actor.
