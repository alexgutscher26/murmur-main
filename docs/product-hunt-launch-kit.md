## 5. First-Comment Talking Points (Maker Script)

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋 I'm Alex, creator of Murmur.

Over the past year, AI voice dictation experienced a massive renaissance. Being able to articulate thoughts at 160 WPM completely transformed how we review code, write technical documentation, draft emails, and capture meeting notes.

However, when we looked under the hood of popular dictation apps, we were shocked: almost every single tool streams raw microphone audio over WebSockets to remote multi-tenant cloud GPU clusters.

For engineers working on proprietary codebases, lawyers drafting privileged briefs, and clinicians writing patient notes, that architecture is a complete non-starter. Furthermore, round-tripping voice audio across the internet adds 400–1,200ms of latency, breaks on airplanes or spotty Wi-Fi, and ends with a $15/month subscription.

So we set out to build what dictation should have been from day one:
**Murmur** — a fast, polished voice dictation app that runs 100% locally on your computer.

### What Makes Murmur Different:
⚡ **Instant Sub-180ms Latency:** Audio is decoded directly on your GPU via `whisper.cpp` (Apple Silicon Metal & Windows DirectML). It is actually faster than cloud round-trips because there is zero network handshake.
🔒 **Air-Gapped Privacy:** Audio stays in RAM and is purged the instant text is typed at your cursor. Zero telemetry, zero analytics SDKs, and zero cloud accounts required.
🎯 **App-Aware Formatting:** Murmur recognizes whether you are in VS Code, Notion, Slack, or an email client and applies appropriate casing and punctuation automatically.
📖 **Custom Phonetic Dictionary:** Add your proprietary microservice names, team jargon, or code terms (`kubectl`, `async/await`, `serde_json`) so Whisper never mishears them.
💻 **Native Performance:** Built in Rust and Tauri 2 with an idle memory footprint of less than 45MB.

### Our Launch Gift to the Community:
Murmur is **free and open source (MIT)**. You can download it today and use it with unlimited words forever.

For power users who want advanced model switching (Whisper Medium/Large) and custom workflow profiles, we are offering **25% off** our Core Lifetime perpetual license and Pro tier with coupon code **HUNTER25** for the next 72 hours!

Grab the build at https://murmur.app or inspect our code at https://github.com/webprodigies/murmur.

Turn off your Wi-Fi, hold ⌥ Space (or Alt+Space), and let us know your feedback below! I'll be in the comments all day answering questions about whisper.cpp FFI, DirectML compute shaders, and latency benchmarking. 🚀
